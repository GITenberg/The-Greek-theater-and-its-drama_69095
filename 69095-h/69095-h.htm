<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>Prior to the outbreak of the world-war in Europe it seemed
that America was about to pass through a period of great popular
interest in the drama. With the return of normal activities
consequent upon the coming of peace it is to be hoped that this
interest may be revived and may continue to grow. So far as
such interest is hysterical or manifested by attempts at play-writing
on the part of those without training, experience, or
natural aptitude it has little to commend it. On the other
hand, nothing can be more wholesome than a widespread comprehension
of the origin, history, and basic principles of tragedy
and comedy. Thus, we are deeply indebted to the successive
scholars who have undertaken to analyze Elizabethan drama and
assign to Seneca, the Latin comedians, Aristotle, the Greek
playwrights, and the various mediaeval elements their respective
shares of influence. But, as the ultimate source of all other
dramatic art, the Greeks’ contribution, whether in precept or
example, must ever occupy a unique position. Accordingly, no
effort, however humble, to make the theater and drama of the
Greeks more widely known ought to require an apology.</p>

<p>In the following pages I have tried to do three things:</p>

<p>First, to elaborate the theory that the peculiarities and conventions
of the Greek drama are largely explicable by its environment,
in the broadest sense of that term. Some aspects of this
fundamental proposition have already been developed by others.
But, so far as results have been sought in the field of classical
drama, it has been done less comprehensively than is here
attempted; and the earlier work has been, for the most part,
antiquated by the momentous accession of new information
during the last twenty-five years.</p>

<p>Secondly, to emphasize the technical aspect of ancient drama.
Technique has largely escaped the attention even of our playwrights,
some of whom attempt to produce plays that will have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
none. Most of our classical scholars, also, study and teach and
edit the ancient dramatists as if they, too, had been equally
slipshod. Our handbooks on scenic antiquities and the classical
drama have been written from the same point of view. Of late
years the Germans have awakened to the real situation, and
many of their recent monographs deal with various phases of
the subject. Nevertheless, so lately as 1911 a German dissertation
began with these words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As yet not very many investigations into the technique of the Greek
tragedians are available. In addition to the incidental hints that are
scattered here and there, especially in the commentaries, two works in this
field are above all to be mentioned and they are both very recent: Adolf
Gross, <i>Die Stichomythie in der griechischen Tragödie und Komödie</i> (1905),
and Friedrich Leo, <i>Der Monolog im Drama</i> (1908).<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In what terms, then, ought the indifference, not to say the
unawareness, of American scholars with regard to these matters
to be characterized? It is true that quite recently the German
publications have caused some attention to be devoted, in this
country, to the dramaturgy of the classical playwrights; but
as yet such researches have gained only scant recognition from
the generality of classical students.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to elucidate and freshen ancient practice by modern
and mediaeval parallels. This is an old and deeply worked mine,
and I am under heavy obligations to my predecessors; but the
vein is inexhaustible, and I have striven to keep the point in
mind more steadfastly than is sometimes the case. It is of a
piece with this to add that I have endeavored to treat the ancient
plays as if they were not dead and inert, belonging to a world
apart, but as if their authors were men as real as Ibsen or Galsworthy,
who had real problems and met them in a real way.
The desirability of this point of view surely ought not to be a
matter of question; yet in fact it is exemplified with surprising
rareness. To many, Sophocles and Euripides seem to possess
scarcely more historicity than the heroes of Greek mythology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span></p>

<p>To a varying degree all these aims run afoul of a historic
controversy among dramatic critics. In the <i>Poetics</i> Aristotle
recognized the distinction between studying tragedy “by itself”
and in reference also to the audience (or theater).<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He included
“spectacle” (ὄψις) or “the equipment of the spectacle” (ὁ τῆς
ὄψεως κόσμος) among the six parts which every tragedy must
have, but proceeded to declare that “this, though emotionally
attractive, is least artistic of the parts and has least to do with
the art of poetry, since the power of tragedy exists even apart
from a public performance and actors and since, furthermore, it
is the art of the costumer (or stage machinist) rather than that
of the poet to secure spectacular effects.” He granted that
“fear and pity may be excited by the spectacle, but they may
be excited also by the inner structure of the play, which is the
preferable method and is typical of a better poet,” etc. “The
power of a tragedy,” he thought, “may be made manifest by
merely reading it.” Finally, he pointed out that music and
spectacle are just the accessories in which tragedy surpasses epic
poetry and that they constitute no inconsiderable addition to
its effect by rendering its pleasures most vivid. These citations
suffice to show Aristotle’s attitude, which was consistently
maintained: he believed the spectacle to be one of the indispensable
elements of drama, but that it ought also to be a
comparatively subordinate element. This was an eminently
sane position to take, and it would have been well if his successors
had been equally judicious.</p>

<p>Dr. Spingarn has tried to break down the force of Aristotle’s
recognition of spectacular effects by saying that he could not
“help thinking of plays in connection with their theatrical
representation, any more than most of us can think of men and
women without clothes. They belong together by long habit
and use; they help each other to be what we commonly think
them. But he does not make them identical or mutually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
inclusive.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In other words, Aristotle had no acquaintance with
the “closet-drama,” and so did not take it into account. But
there is an allowance to be made also on the other side. There
is some doubt as to just what Aristotle meant by “spectacle,”
whether merely “the visible appearance of the actors when got
up in character by the costumier” or “scenery, dresses—the
whole visible apparatus of the theater.” Even if he had the
larger meaning in mind he could not have realized its full
significance. He knew but a single type of theatrical building,
which must therefore have seemed to him as integral a part of
dramatic performances as the Greek climate. He could not
look down the ages and contrast the simple arrangements of the
Greek theater with the varying lighting effects and scenic
splendor of modern and intervening types. He could not avoid,
then, underestimating the importance of this factor. Furthermore,
when he states that of the six parts the spectacle has least
to do with the art of poetry and is more closely related to the art
of the costumer than to that of the poet, he means what he says
and no more. As its title indicates, his treatise was concerned
with the art of poetry, not with that of dramaturgy. Hence he
stressed the factors that dealt with the essence of tragedy rather
than those which influenced only its accidental features and
external form. Even so, he conceded to the latter elements no
negligible value. Considered from the dramaturgical standpoint
as well, he must have allowed them a much greater importance.</p>

<p>As it happens, Spingarn confines his examination of Aristotle’s
views to the <i>Poetics</i>, but in the <i>Rhetoric</i> occurs the interesting
observation that “on the stage the actors are at present of more
importance than the poets.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Aristotle did not state that this
was the proper relationship, but as a practical man he simply
recognized the facts before his eyes. And these words utterly repudiate
Spingarn’s attempt to subvert the obvious implication
of Aristotle’s statements in the <i>Poetics</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span></p>

<p>I have given so much space to Aristotle’s opinions because
Spingarn did. But, after all, it does not greatly matter. Times
have changed since Roger Bacon placed the crown of infallibility
on the Stagirite’s brow with the words: “Aristotle hath the same
authority in philosophy that the apostle Paul hath in divinity.”
The investigation of such questions no longer begins and ends
with “the master of those that know.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless I conceive Aristotle’s position in the present
matter to have been a sensible one, though it has oftentimes been
sadly disregarded and even flouted. One school has ignored the
spectacle as a factor in dramatic criticism. The other school has
exalted it to the chief place. In my opinion both attitudes are
erroneous. The former party is the older and more numerous.
I fancy that most adherents of this view err unconsciously. It
is particularly easy in dealing with the dramatic remains of
bygone ages to ignore or minimize the effect which the manner of
presentation must have exercised and practically to confine one’s
attention to literary criticism in the narrowest sense of the term.
To this tendency classical scholars have been peculiarly prone.
But there are many others who are quite aware of the full
meaning of the position they occupy. One of these is Spingarn,
who roundly declares: “A play is a creative work of the imagination,
and must be considered as such always, <i>and as such only</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The opposing view seems to have been promulgated first by
Castelvetro (1570) and enjoyed no particular popularity until recently.
It was adopted by the Abbé d’Aubignac in the seventeenth
century, by Diderot in the eighteenth century, by A. W.
Schlegel during the first half of the nineteenth century, and by
Francisque Sarcey during the latter half. There is no space here
to trace the developments of the doctrine; for that the interested
reader may consult Spingarn’s article. But the general position
of the school is as follows: “A play is a story (<i>a</i>) devised to be
presented (<i>b</i>) by actors (<i>c</i>) on a stage (<i>d</i>) before an audience.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
These are not merely important elements or essential elements;
they are the prime elements. They outweigh all other considerations.
It was Diderot’s central idea that the essential part of a
play was not created by the poet at all, but by the actor. The
“closet-drama” they hold up to scorn as a contradiction in
terms. The “psychology of the crowd,” long before that name
for it had been invented, was an integral part of this teaching.
The inadequacy of this point of view is aptly expressed in
Goethe’s words concerning Schlegel: “His criticism is completely
one-sided, because in all theatrical pieces he merely regards the
skeleton of the plot and arrangement, and only points out small
points of resemblance to great predecessors, without troubling
himself in the least as to what the author brings forward of
graceful life and the culture of a high soul.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>To me neither of these theories is satisfactory. I conceive
the truth to lie between them. Etymologically the word
“drama” means “action,” and the practice of the Greek theater
for centuries shows that an action carried on by living impersonators
is involved. Action narrated on a printed page is not
enough. I am willing to concede that by a natural extension of
meaning a piece which was confessedly written for the closet and
which does not and cannot succeed upon the stage may nevertheless
deserve to be called a “drama.” But despite its poetic
charm and other merits such a drama <i>qua</i> drama is indeed a <i>vie
manquée</i>. On the other hand, against the materialistic school
I maintain the self-evident proposition that it is possible for a
play to observe all the technical rules arising from the conditions
of performance in a theater and before an audience and yet be
so lacking in poetry, in truth to life, in inherent worth, as to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
undeserving of the name of “drama.” It is evident, then, that
craftsmanship must be the medium of the playwright, not his
sole possession. But, in truth, the issue here is more apparent
than real. It does not confront us in practice. Both these
extremes constitute a negligible fraction of our dramatic literature.
Students of the drama in university seminars, dramatic
reviewers in the theaters, and playwrights at their desks, at
least those who aspire to an enduring fame, alike draw upon the
same body of plays for their knowledge of dramatic lore—upon
Shakespeare, Euripides, Molière, Lessing, Sophocles, Ibsen.
All these masters had a close and practical knowledge of the
theater for which they wrote. On the other hand, they were
infinitely more than mere technicians.</p>

<p>But Spingarn would maintain that the aesthetic value of a
play is entirely independent of theatrical conditions or the
conventions arising therefrom. “For aesthetic criticism the
theater simply does not exist” (cf. <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 89). Surely, if
Sophocles were writing plays for the present-day public he
would find it necessary to dispense with the choral odes which
have been at once the delight and the despair of Greek students
from his generation to this. Would not such an omission and
the consequent readjustments affect the aesthetic value of his
tragedies? Or if one of our dramatists could be set down in a
Greek theater of some twenty-four hundred years ago, which
was incapable of representing an interior scene and had never
contained a box set, certainly his dramas would have to be
turned literally inside out before they could be produced at all.
Would this recasting in no wise affect their aesthetic criticism?
Spingarn is anxious to protect Aristotle from the imputation of
believing that plays and their theatrical representation are
“mutually inclusive.” But his own position makes them
mutually exclusive. Both theories are extreme and unwarranted.
I have already quoted Spingarn’s conception of a play. In my
opinion, Mr. Galsworthy’s putting of the matter is not only
broader, but far preferable, for the reason that it duly recognizes,
as Spingarn’s dictum does not, the facts of existence. He writes:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
“For what is Art but the perfected expression of self in contact
with the world?”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> While this definition takes full cognizance
of aesthetic and spiritual values, it yet does not exclude such
unmentioned but implicit factors as the medium of expression
chosen by the artist, the circumstances under which his work is
created and is to be exhibited, the past history and inherited
conventions of the genre, etc. On the contrary, it is apparent
that Galsworthy would not, after the fashion of the materialistic
school, elevate these indispensable, though subordinate, matters
to the exclusion of all else.</p>

<p>It thus appears that I array myself neither with the aesthetic
nor with the materialistic school of critics, but occupy middle
ground. Nevertheless, my book is devoted, in the main, to a
consideration of the more materialistic and external factors in
the development of Greek drama. These factors are different
manifestations of Environment, which is a far broader term than
Aristotle’s Spectacle (ὄψις). I entertain no illusion as to the comparative
importance of environment in the criticism of drama.
It is distinctly of secondary importance. If it were possible to
study Greek drama from but one point of view, perhaps this
would not deserve to be that one. But since no such restriction
obtains, it is my contention that a consideration of these factors,
too, is not merely valuable, but essential to a complete survey
of the field.</p>

<p>It will now be seen why I have no chapter on the “Influence
of the Poet.” He can hardly be considered a part of his own
environment. But there were also other reasons for the omission.
Partly it was because every chapter shows the mastermind
of the dramatist adapting himself to the situation therein
outlined, and partly because an adequate treatment of this topic
would involve a presentation of the poets’ ideas and teaching—a
subject which is amply discussed in other treatises and which
would swell this volume beyond the limits at my disposal. I
am aware that to some the result will seem to give the uninitiated
a lopsided view of the Greek drama. For example, a reviewer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
of Signor Francesco Guglielmino’s <i>Arte e Artifizio nel Dramma
Greco</i> (Catania, 1912) maintains that “for the reader who is not
technically a scholar” such a study of dramatic technique
presents “a subtly distorted picture.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> To this criticism my
reply would be that the standard handbooks are guilty of much
the same error in largely ignoring the phase of the subject which
is here presented. But however that may be, for the language
and style or for the political, moral, ethical, and religious ideas of
ancient playwrights, I must recommend such invaluable works
as Haigh’s <i>Tragic Drama of the Greeks</i> (1896), Decharme’s
<i>Euripides and the Spirit of His Dramas</i>, Croiset’s <i>Aristophanes
and the Political Parties at Athens</i>, Legrand’s <i>The New Greek
Comedy</i> (the last three translated by Loeb, 1906, 1909, and 1917),
Sheppard’s <i>Greek Tragedy</i> (1911), Murray’s <i>Euripides and His
Age</i> (1913), etc. I must add, however, that to a certain extent
these books treat also of the matters discussed in this volume
and have freely been consulted.</p>

<p>In this connection I wish to comment upon another objection.
Several of my articles which are incorporated in the present
volume antedate Guglielmino’s work, and my whole book was
blocked out and large parts of it were written before his <i>Arte e
Artifizio</i> came to my attention. Nevertheless my plan of treatment
bears some points of resemblance to his. In particular, he
employs the chauvinistic passages in Greek tragedy to show the
poets striving for “immediate effects,” i.e., deliberately exciting
the patriotic sentiments of their audiences. It will be observed
that I go a step farther and maintain that the winning of the
prize was the ultimate object, to which the other motive was
contributory (see <a href="#Page_213">pp. 213 ff.</a>, below). I believe that the tag at
the end of Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i>, <i>Orestes</i>, and
<i>Phoenician Maids</i> and the parallels from Greek comedy confirm
my interpretation. But the reviewer just cited declares it</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">unfair to the dramatist and his art to forget that he and his audience were
all Athenians together.... When the Athenian dramatist, sharing the
Athenian pride in their country’s history or legend, makes a character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
express a common patriotic emotion or belief, we cannot properly call that
flattery of the audience, or an artifice for effect, even though the words
were sure to call out rapturous applause. The bit of truth in such a view
is so partial as to be false.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But, as Professor Murray says of the choral ode in the <i>Medea</i>,
“They are not at all the conventional glories attributed by all
patriots to their respective countries.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Moreover, these passages
usually rest upon no popular belief, for the simple reason
that they frequently corresponded neither to history nor to
traditional mythology, but dealt with incidents that had been
newly invented by the poet’s fancy or had at least been invested
by him with new details and setting.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the European conflagration in August,
1914, London managers hastened to bring out such plays as
<i>Drake</i>, <i>Henry V</i>, and <i>An Englishman’s Home</i>. Was this merely
the prompting of genuinely patriotic fervor on their part, or a
misdirected attempt to exploit the emotions of their countrymen?
The fact that this class of plays was soon withdrawn after
it became apparent that the public heard enough about the war
elsewhere without being reminded of it also in the theaters favors
the latter explanation. Now, that Aristophanes frankly angled
for the suffrages of his audiences cannot be denied. When,
then, we remember how Euripides began to write for the stage
when he was only eighteen, how he had to wait for a chorus in the
great contest until he was thirty and then gained only the last
place, how his first victory was deferred until 441 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> when he was
forty-four years of age, how few were the victories that he won,
how he courted his public by seeking out unhackneyed themes,
by inventing sensational episodes, by reverting to the mannerisms
of Aeschylus, by introducing sex problems—when we remember
all this, can it be doubted that his chauvinistic passages were
part and parcel of the same policy and were deliberately written
with the same motives as are revealed in the choice of plays by
Sir Herbert Tree and the other London managers of today?</p>

<p>But perhaps it may be said that the psychology of managers
is utterly unlike that of poets. In reply it would be possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
and sufficient to cite the not infrequent concessions which
Shakespeare and many another have made to the groundlings
in their audiences, but I prefer to quote the words of a dramatist
who has declared himself on the subject more explicitly.
Mr. Henry Arthur Jones has recently written:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A dramatist is often reproached for producing plays that are obviously
below the standard of his aspirations, and obviously below the level of his
best work. This assumes that the dramatist is, like the novelist, always
free to do his best work. There could not be a greater mistake. The dramatist
is limited and curbed by a thousand conditions which are never suspected
by the public. The drama will always remain a popular art.... The
dramatist who writes plays too far ahead, or too far away from the taste
and habits of thought of the general body of playgoers, finds the theatre
empty, his manager impoverished, and his own reputation and authority
diminished or lost. No sympathy should be given to dramatists, however
lofty their aims, who will not study to please the general body of playgoers
of their days.... The question to be asked concerning a dramatist is—“Does
he desire to give the public the best they will accept from him, or
does he give them the readiest filth or nonsense that most quickly pays?”
He cannot always even give the public the best that they would accept from
him. In sitting down to write a play, he must first ask himself, “Can I get
a manager of repute to produce this, and in such a way and at such a theatre
that it can be seen to advantage? Can I get some leading actor or actress
to play this part for the benefit of the play as a whole? Can I get these
other individual types of character played in such a way that they will
appear to be something like the persons I have in my mind?” These and
a hundred other questions the dramatist has to ask himself before he decides
upon the play he will write. A mistake in the casting of a secondary character
may ruin a play, so narrow is the margin of success.... I hope I
may be forgiven for intruding this personal matter by way of excuse and
explanation. In no case do I blame or arraign the public, who, in the
theatre, will always remain my masters, and whose grateful and willing
servant I shall always remain.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It should be recognized that my book is intended for two very
diverse types of readers, whose demands likewise are dissimilar:</p>

<p>First, for a general reading public which has little or no
acquaintance with the Greek and Latin classics in the original
but has a deep and abiding interest in the drama together with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
a desire to learn more of the prototypes and masterpieces of the
genre. This situation has made necessary an amplitude of
explanatory matter which, I fear, will at times prove irksome
to my professional confrères. On the other hand, I have felt
that intellectual honesty required me to treat the topics discussed
in my Introduction and to meet the problems there raised
at some length and without evasions. But to do so necessitated
the interpretation of Greek texts and the presentation of much
jejune material. Perhaps, therefore, some of my non-classical
readers will prefer to omit the Introduction. By cross-references
and slight repetitions I have endeavored to make the rest of the
book intelligible without it. The English word “stage” is too
convenient to be avoided in discussing theatrical matters, but
those who omit the third section of the Introduction are to
understand that its use in my text does not mean that I believe
that the Greek theater of the fourth and fifth centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
had a raised stage for the exclusive use of actors.</p>

<p>Secondly, although much that I have written is necessarily
well known to classicists, still, since I have striven to incorporate
the results of the latest investigations and have arranged under
one co-ordinating principle phenomena which are usually
regarded as unrelated, and since I have combined points of
interpretation which are scattered through scores of books and
monographs, I venture to hope that my discussion will not be
without interest even for specialists.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the comedies of Plautus and Terence are but
translations and adaptations of Greek originals, and since
Seneca’s tragedies are constructed upon the Greek model, I
have not hesitated to cite these Latin plays whenever they
seemed to afford better illustrations than purely Greek productions.</p>

<p>I must express my constant indebtedness to such invaluable
storehouses of data as Müller’s <i>Lehrbuch der griechischen Bühnenalterthümer</i>
(1886) and <i>Das attische Bühnenwesen</i> (1902), Navarre’s
<i>Dionysos</i> (1895), and especially Haigh’s <i>The Attic Theatre</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
third edition by Pickard-Cambridge (1907); also to Butcher’s
<i>Aristotle’s Theory of Poetry and Fine Art</i>, fourth edition with
corrections (1911), and Bywater’s edition of Aristotle’s <i>Poetics</i>
(1909).</p>

<p>I desire to thank the editors for permission, graciously
granted, to use material which I have already published in
<i>Classical Philology</i>, V (1910), VII (1912), and VIII (1913), the
<i>Classical Weekly</i>, III (1910), VIII (1915), X (1917), and XI
(1918), and the <i>Classical Journal</i>, VII (1911) and X (1914).
Needless to state, these papers have not been brought over into
the present volume verbatim, but have been curtailed, expanded,
revised, and rearranged according to need. Furthermore, fully
two-thirds of the book are entirely new.</p>

<p>Permission to quote from Mr. A. S. Way’s translation of
Euripides in the “Loeb Classical Library,” Dr. B. B. Rogers’
translation of Aristophanes, and Professor J. S. Blackie’s translation
of Aeschylus in “Everyman’s Library” has been courteously
granted by William Heinemann, London (G. P. Putnam’s
Sons, New York), G. Bell &amp; Sons, and J. M. Dent &amp; Sons,
respectively.</p>

<p>To my friends, Professor D. M. Robinson of Johns Hopkins
University and Dr. A. S. Cooley of Bethlehem, Pa., I am indebted
for having placed at my disposal their collections of photographs
of Greek theaters. My colleague, Professor M. R. Hammer of
the Northwestern University College of Engineering, has put
me under deep obligation by supervising the preparation of
several of the drawings.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my heartiest thanks are due to Professor
Edward Capps, who first introduced me to the study of scenic
antiquities. Several parts of this book, when originally published
as articles, have enjoyed the benefit of his invaluable
suggestions and criticisms. It is unnecessary to add, however,
that he must not be held responsible for any part of them in their
present form.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>In undertaking to treat of a subject concerning hardly a
detail of which can any statement be made without the possibility
of dispute, the unfortunate necessity rests upon me of
beginning with three topics which are the most controversial
of all—the origin of tragedy, the origin of comedy, and the
Greek theater. Instead of trying to conceal our ignorance on
these matters by vague generalities, I shall set forth such data
as are known, and attempt, clearly and frankly, to erect hypotheses
to answer the questions that most naturally arise, even
though this very striving for clearness and frankness will expose
me to attack. I believe with Bacon that “truth emerges sooner
from error than from confusion,” or, as a recent writer has
expressed it, that “the definitizing of error is often the beginning
of its disappearance.” Limits of space will require, at many
points, a dogmatic statement of my views without stopping to
examine the evidence from every angle. It must be understood,
however, that no account of these subjects, whoever its
author or however detailed his treatment, could find universal
acceptance or anything approaching it.</p>

<p class="tb" id="The_Origin_of_Tragedy"><i>The Origin of Tragedy.</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>—It is still the canonical doctrine,
though its modern history goes back no farther than Welcker’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
book on the <i>Satyrspiel</i> in 1826 and though no conclusive testimony
for this view can be cited more ancient than Byzantine
times, that satyric drama was the intermediate stage in the
derivation of tragedy from the dithyramb. The argument runs
somewhat as follows: The dithyramb was an improvisational
song and dance in honor of Dionysus (Bacchus), the god of wine,
and was performed by a band of men provided with goatlike
horns, ears, hoofs, and tails and clad in a goatskin (or in a goat-hair
loin-band) in imitation of Dionysus’ attendant sprites, the
satyrs; on account of this costume the choreutae (members of
the chorus) were sometimes called <i>tragoi</i>, which is the Greek
word for “goats”; in certain localities, as the dithyramb became
quasi-literary and took on a dramatic element, its name was
changed to satyric drama; still later, as these tendencies
increased, especially through the addition of an actor, the satyr-play
came to be called <i>tragoidia</i> (“goat-song”), derived from the
nickname applied to the caprine choreutae; the chorus still
consisted of satyrs and, since these were licentious, bestial
creatures, the performance was yet crude and undignified;
Aeschylus (525-456 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) was possibly the first to abandon satyric
choreutae and was certainly the first to raise tragedy to the rank
of real literature; during the fifth century each poet was required
to follow his group of three tragedies at the dramatic festival
with a satyr-play as a concession to the satyric origin of the
performance.</p>

  and the Peloponnesus, Showing Early Centers of Dramatic Activities in Greece.</p>
</div>

<p>In recent years, essential supports of this doctrine have
slowly crumbled away before searching investigation; at
present, scarcely a single clause in the foregoing sketch would
escape unchallenged by some scholar of deserved standing. An
ever-increasing number of students believe that tragedy is not
the child of the satyr-play, but that the two are separate in their
origin. Unfortunately, however, these dissenters, including such
men as Dr. Emil Reisch of Vienna, Mr. Pickard-Cambridge of
Oxford, Professor Wilhelm Schmid of Tübingen, and Professor
William Ridgeway of Cambridge, though they are unanimous in
rejecting Welcker’s hypothesis, cannot agree among themselves
as to a constructive policy. My own view is that tragedy and
satyric drama are independent offshoots of the same literary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
type, the Peloponnesian dithyramb. The former came to
Athens from Corinth and Sicyon by way of Icaria. Somewhat
later the latter was introduced directly from Phlius by Pratinas,
a native of that place. My reasons for these opinions will
develop in the course of the discussion.</p>

<p>Very recently, notable efforts have been put forth to interpret
the religious practices of the Greeks, partly in the light of anthropology
and partly in accordance with the new psychological
method which inquires, not what the god is, but what are the
social activities and the social organization of his devotees.
Whatever may be said for these avenues of approach in other
respects, in practice those who employ them have shown more
eagerness to assemble data which might be considered confirmatory
of their theories than to reach an unprejudiced interpretation
of the whole body of ancient evidence. Thus, much has
been made of present-day carnivals in Thessaly, Thrace, and
Scyrus,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and these ceremonies are employed as if they were
assured survivals of the primitive rites from which Greek
drama developed and as if their evidence were of greater value
than the most firmly established data in the ancient tradition.
Now the a priori possibility that these carnivals should retain
their essential features unchanged through two and a half
millenniums amid all the vicissitudes which have come upon
these regions must be pronounced infinitesimal. And an
examination of the details confirms this impression. Certain
parts of the ceremonies are parodies of the Christian rites of
marriage and burial. Not only an Arab but also a Frank appear
in the cast of characters. Though Phrynichus is said to have
been the first to represent female rôles,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> such rôles abound in
these modern plays. Yet there is another defect in this
assumption which is still more serious. If there is one well-authenticated
fact in the history of Greek drama, expressly
stated in ancient notices and fully substantiated by the extant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
plays, it is that tragedy arose from a choral performance and
only gradually acquired its histrionic features. On the contrary,
these carnivals are predominantly histrionic; there is
either no chorus or its rôle is distinctly secondary. Had
Aristotle been guilty of such a <i>faux pas</i>, we can easily imagine
the derisive comments in which modern investigators would
have indulged at his expense.</p>

<p>Of course, our evidence is far from being as complete as we
could wish, and must therefore be supplemented at many points
by conjecture pure and simple; but this fact does not justify us
in throwing all our data overboard and in beginning <i>de novo</i>.
In this matter we have been too prone to follow a practice which
the late Professor Verrall characterized, in a different connection,
as follows: “We are perhaps too apt, in speculations of this kind,
to help a theory by the convenient hypothesis of a wondrous
simpleton, who did the mangling, blundering, or whatever it is
that we require.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Now, whatever may be true in other cases,
Aristotle at least was no “simpleton,” competent only to mangle
his sources of information; and furthermore, apart from certain
ethnographic parallels which are of only secondary importance
after all,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> our fund of knowledge in this field is in no wise comparable
with his. In fact, except for the extant plays our
information is almost confined to what we derive, directly or
indirectly, from him. Since this is so, what can be more absurd
than to reject his conclusions and have recourse to unhampered
conjecture?</p>

<p>But if we are to hold fast to Aristotle, one precaution is
necessary—we must be sure that we do not make him say more
or less than he does say. He wrote for a very different audience
from that which now reads his words and with a very different
purpose from that to which his book is now put. And these
factors often render him enigmatical. This resulted also from
his frequently assuming a familiarity with things which now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
cannot always be taken for granted. As Professor Bywater
expressed it: “It is clear from Aristotle’s confession of ignorance
as to comedy that he knows more of the history of tragedy than
he actually tells us, and that he is not aware of there being any
serious lacuna in it.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Thus, Aristotle says that tragedy was
“improvisational by origin” and, more specifically, was derived
“from the leaders of the dithyramb.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Though this expression
unhappily is somewhat lacking in precision, the main item, that
the dithyramb is the parent of tragedy, emerges from any
interpretation. Ridgeway may proceed to dissociate the dithyramb
from Dionysus and to derive it from ceremonies at the
tombs of heroes if he choose; however unwarranted, that is at
least logical. But to ignore this statement of Aristotle’s and to
seek, as many do, to trace tragedy back to δρώμενα (“ritual
acts”) of various kinds by another line of development transgresses
good philological practice.</p>

<p>There is an unfortunate facility in such attempts. Tragedy
embraced many diverse elements in its material and technique.
Accordingly, whatever anyone sets out to find, he can be almost
certain of discovering there. Thus, Dieterich with his theory
of the development of tragedy from funeral dirges, the Eleusinian
mysteries, and various aetiological sources; Ridgeway with his
tomb theory; Miss Harrison with her “Year Spirit” (the
Eniautos-Daimon) and sympathetic magic; and Murray with
his attempt to reconcile and expand the Dieterich-Harrison
theories, all find confirmation for their views in the same body
of dramatic literature. The very facility of such analyzing is
its undoing.</p>

<p>Moreover, despite numerous attempts to the contrary, the
real nature of the primitive dithyramb can scarcely be a matter
of doubt. Plato, who was also no “simpleton,” defined it as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
song in celebration of the birth of Dionysus.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Now since the
dithyramb is known to have been opened up to a wider range of
themes considerably before Plato’s time, his definition must apply
to the original meaning of the term. This interpretation does
not remain unsupported. Thus, the first extant instance of the
words occurs in a fragment of Archilochus (<i>ca.</i> 680-640 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), who
declares that he “knows how, when his heart is crazed with wine,
to lead lord Dionysus’ dithyramb.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It should be observed that
Archilochus does not say that he knows how to write a dithyramb,
but how to take part in one as a drunken ἐξάρχων (“leader”).
Such a performance was doubtless, as Aristotle said, largely
improvisational, being perhaps coupled with the rendition of
some ritual chant (καλὸν μέλος). Dionysus is characterized as
θριαμβο-διθύραμβος (“celebrated in dithyrambs”) by Pratinas,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and addressed as διθύραμβος by Euripides in his <i>Bacchanals</i>, vs.
526. In an ode in honor of the victories which were won by
Xenophon of Corinth in 464 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Pindar inquires, “Whence
appeared the charms of Dionysus in connection with the ox-driving
dithyramb?”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Here, also, the author is not referring to
the Corinthian dithyramb of his own day but to the period when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
it was put upon a quasi-literary level by Arion (see below).
Finally, Epicharmus went so far as to declare that “when you
drink water, it isn’t a dithyramb,”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> showing that the more
primitive meaning of the term was not crowded out by later
developments. These passages are sufficient to show that
the dithyramb was at all times intimately associated with
Dionysus and at the beginning belonged to him exclusively;
their force is not invalidated by the acknowledged fact that at
an early period (see <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>, below) the restriction was broken
down.</p>

<p>It was not until after the middle of the seventh century that
the dithyramb became “poetized.” This step was taken by
Arion of Methymna in Lesbos, then resident in Corinth. His
connection with the dithyramb and early tragedy is vouched for
by irrefutable evidence. Solon of Athens (639-559 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) is
said in a recently discovered notice<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to have declared in his
<i>Elegies</i> that “Arion introduced the first drama of tragedy.”
The question immediately arises as to exactly what language
Solon had employed. The words τῆς τραγῳδίας πρῶτον δρᾶμα are,
of course, only a paraphrase, for no form of the word τραγῳδία can
be used in elegiac verse. This objection does not lie against the
word δρᾶμα, however, and it will be remembered that the Dorians
based their claims to tragedy partly upon this non-Attic term.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.
Thus, we obtain an explanation of the cumbersome circumlocution
“the first drama of tragedy.” In Solon’s <i>Elegies</i> the
author of this notice (or his source) found only the ambiguous
term δρᾶμα. A desire to retain the terminology of the original
prevented his frankly substituting τραγῳδία. Accordingly, he
kept δρᾶμα but inserted the qualifying genitive τῆς τραγῳδίας.
I do not understand that Aristotle either indorses or rejects the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Dorian pretensions with respect to this word; but in view of
our present evidence I am of the opinion that Arion called his
performances “dramas” and was the first to use the word in
this sense and that there is so much of justice in the Dorian
claims. It is not necessary to believe, however, that they were
ever called <i>satyric</i> dramas, see <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>, below.</p>

<p>Now, Dr. Nilsson has objected that Solon would have had no
occasion to express his opinion upon a matter of this kind (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 611, note). But the mention of the title of the work from
which the citation purports to come goes far to substantiate its
genuineness. Furthermore, Solon was incensed at Thespis (see
<a href="#Page_17">pp. 17 f.</a>, below), and therefore it was only natural that he should
take an interest in the matter, assign the distinction to another,
and state his opinion in as public a manner as possible. The fact
that he lived in the days before real (Aeschylean) tragedy and
before the importance of Thespis’ innovations was understood
explains the error in his judgment. But at the very least, this
notice proves that the tradition of Arion’s connection with
tragedy was current as early as the first half of the sixth
century.</p>

<p>Pindar’s reference to the development of the dithyramb at
Corinth has already been mentioned. In the next generation
Herodotus characterized Arion as follows: “Arion was second
to none of the harpists of that time and was the first of the men
known to us to compose (ποιήσαντα) a dithyramb and to give it
a name (ὀνομάσαντα) and to represent it at Corinth” (I, 23).
It is customary nowadays to seek to explain such notices as
arising from the rival claims of jealous cities; but be it noted
that here are two Attic sympathizers, Solon and Herodotus,
granting full recognition to the literary achievements of a neighboring
city. In fact, Herodotus is apparently too generous, for
Arion could not have been the inventor of the dithyramb, broadly
speaking. But ποιεῖν denotes not only “to compose” but also
“to poetize,” and the latter translation is in better accord with
what else we know of Arion’s contribution to the history of the
dithyramb. On the other hand, ὀνομάσαντα probably means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
that in Herodotus’ opinion Arion was the first to give names
(titles) to his performances.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>A Byzantine writer repeats and amplifies Herodotus’ statements
but adds one interesting clause to the effect that Arion
“introduced satyrs speaking in meter.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In this there is nothing
surprising. In the Peloponnesus caprine satyrs were regular
attendants upon Dionysus, and in consequence the dithyrambic
choreutae must usually have been thought of as satyrs. Their
improvisations, also, must always have engaged the speaking as
well as the singing voice. This fact, however, did not at this
time involve histrionic impersonation (μίμησις) for the reason
that they would not attempt to say what was appropriate to
satyrs but to themselves <i>in propria persona</i> as revelers and
worshipers. The word ἔμμετρα (“in meter”), therefore, is the
important one. The use of meter marked the coming of artistic
finish and the passing of a performance largely extemporaneous.
Some idea of the technique of Arion’s productions may be drawn
from a dithyramb by Bacchylides (first half of the fifth century)
in honor of Theseus. This is in the form of a lyric dialogue and
was doubtless influenced somewhat by contemporaneous tragedy.
The chorus of Athenians, addressing Aegeus, king of Athens,
inquires why a call to arms has been sounded (vss. 1-15), and
the <i>coryphaeus</i> (“chorus-leader”) replies that a herald has just
arrived and summarizes his message (vss. 16-30). The chorus
asks for further details (vss. 31-45), and once more the king’s
reply is borrowed from the herald (vss. 46-60). Here Theseus,
not Dionysus, is the theme of the poem; the choreutae do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
represent satyrs, but appear in their true character as plain
citizens of Athens; and the coryphaeus is given a dramatic
character, that of Aegeus. These are all developments later
than the time of Arion; nevertheless, the general effect must have
been much the same.</p>

<p>Before the close of the sixth century the dithyramb had
become a regular form of literature—a chorus of fifty, dancing
and singing formal compositions. In 508 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> a contest of dithyrambic
choruses of men was made a standing feature of the program
at the City Dionysia in Athens. Simonides (556-467 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
is known to have composed a dithyramb entitled <i>Memnon</i>, the
exclusively Dionysiac character of the genre being then, if not
earlier, abandoned. But it is important to remember that originally
the dithyramb was extemporaneous and confined to the
worship and exaltation of Dionysus.</p>

<p>In the new notice concerning Solon and Arion, von Wilamowitz
finds “die Bestätigung dass die τραγῳδοί vor Thespis
bestanden” (cf. <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 470). This development could
scarcely have taken place at Corinth in Arion’s time, for there
was no need of coining a new word to designate the performers
so long as they appeared as satyrs. And if a term had then been
derived from the choreutae to designate their performance, it
must have been *σατυρῳδία and not τραγῳδία. Neither could the
new term have been derived at this period from the <i>prize</i>, for
then the goat was only the third award.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Let us therefore turn
to Sicyon.</p>

<p>In a well-known passage (v. 67) Herodotus tells how the
Sicyonians used to honor their former king, Adrastus, in other
ways, and in particular celebrated his sorrows with “tragic”
(or “goat”) choruses (τραγικοῖσι χοροῖσι) and how their tyrant
Clisthenes in anger at Adrastus assigned these choruses to
Dionysus and the other features of the rites to Melanippus.
Melanippus in his lifetime had killed Adrastus’ brother and
son-in-law, and Clisthenes had brought his bones from Thebes
and transferred to him part of the honors which had previously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
been paid to Adrastus, in order to insult the latter as outrageously
as possible. The superimposition of the worship of Dionysus
upon that of the local hero and the reference to tragic choruses
have furnished Ridgeway a foundation upon which to rear his
theory that tragedy developed from ceremonies at the tombs of
heroes. In this passage the meaning of the word τραγικοῖσι has
provoked much discussion. I believe that Herodotus meant
τραγικός here in the sense current in his own day, viz., tragic,
but I do not believe that he stopped to consider whether these
Sicyonian dances “were sufficiently like the choruses in the
tragedies of his contemporaries to be called ‘tragic.’”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I think
he employed that adjective simply because τραγικοὶ χοροί was
the Sicyonians’ own designation for their performances. If so,
whatever τραγικοῖσι χοροῖσι connoted to Herodotus, or even to
contemporaneous Sicyonians, originally τραγικός in this phrase
must have meant “goat,” and these choruses must originally
have been, for whatever reason, “goat” choruses.</p>

<p>Some considered Epigenes of Sicyon the first tragic poet,
Thespis being second (or as others thought, sixteenth) in the list.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
In connection with Epigenes another tradition must be mentioned.
Several explanations are preserved of the proverb
oὐδὲν πρὸς τὸν Διόνυσον (“nothing to do with Dionysus”). These
are somewhat vague in details and need not be taken too
seriously; but at least they are valuable as showing the general
periods in which their authors thought that the proper situation
for the rise of such a proverb had existed. According to one
account, this expression was uttered “when Epigenes had composed
a tragedy in honor of Dionysus.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In just what particular
Epigenes’ performance seemed alien to the worship of Dionysus
the retailers of the anecdote do not specify. Ridgeway supposes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
that Epigenes “did not confine himself to Dionysiac subjects.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
But surely that development came much later. In my opinion,
the explanation is simpler. We have no information as to the
costume which the choreutae wore in honoring the sorrows of
Adrastus. There was, of course, no reason for their appearing
as satyrs. But were satyric choreutae introduced at the same
time that the dances were given over to Dionysus? If we answer
this question in the negative, the situation becomes clear. The
audience, or part of it, was sufficiently acquainted with the
performances instituted by Arion at Corinth to expect a chorus
of satyrs in the Sicyonian dances after they were transferred to
Dionysus. And when Epigenes brought on his choreutae in the
same (non-satyric) costume as had previously been employed,
they naturally manifested their surprise with the ejaculation:
οὐδὲν πρὸς τὸν Διόνυσον. By this they meant: “Why, these
choreutae are just what we have had all the time; there is
nothing of the satyrs about them. They have nothing to do
with Dionysus.”</p>

<p>Practically everyone is convinced that τραγῳδία means
“goat-song.” The only difficulty consists in explaining how
this name came to be applied. We have already noted (see
<a href="#Page_2">p. 2</a>, above) that Welcker explained it on the basis of costume,
and this is now the prevailing view. But though the choreutae
at Corinth were satyrs, there were good reasons why no new term
should be coined there to designate them (see <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>, above), and
in fact, τραγῳδία, τραγῳδός (“goat-singer”), and τραγικός (in a
technical sense) apparently did not originate there. On the
other hand, in Sicyon (where at least the expression τραγικοὶ
χοροί, if not the others, seems to have been in use at an early
day) the costume of the choreutae was assuredly not caprine
before the dances were transferred from Adrastus to Dionysus
and probably was not thereafter. Consequently, Welcker’s
explanation must be rejected.</p>

<p>But the earliest and favorite explanation of these terms in
antiquity derived them from the fact that a goat was given to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
victorious poet as a prize.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Knowledge and approval of this
interpretation can be traced almost uninterruptedly from the
high authority of the <i>Parian Chronicle</i><a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> in the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
onward, and there is no cogent reason for doubting its truth.
The other suggestion that the name was derived from the goat
which was offered in sacrifice in connection with the performances
will be seen not to conflict with this view when it is remembered
that in the later dithyrambic contests the prize (a tripod) was
not regarded as the personal possession of the victor but was
customarily consecrated in some temple or other public place.
In my opinion, these explanations have been most unwarrantably
abandoned in modern times, and I think a reaction in their
favor has set in. They are spoken of respectfully by Dr. Reisch,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and Mr. Pickard-Cambridge mentions them exclusively.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Now the transfer of the Sicyonian dances from Adrastus to
Dionysus would probably happen early in the reign of Clisthenes
(<i>ca.</i> 595-560 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and for this very period Eusebius preserves a
notice to the effect that “a goat was given to contestants among
the Greeks, and from this fact they were called τραγικοί.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> I
therefore believe that Herodotus, Eusebius (Jerome), and Suidas
all refer to the same event: that Clisthenes of Sicyon established
the goat prize about 590 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> when he surrendered to Dionysus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the dances which had previously been performed in honor of
Adrastus,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> that Epigenes was the poet whom Clisthenes employed
to initiate this innovation, and that non-satyric choreutae and
the terms τραγικός, τραγῳδός, etc., arose in this manner, time, and
place. The neatness with which these notices fit together to
produce this result renders them comparatively secure from the
critical assault which might more successfully be directed
against them individually. In any case, it is incumbent upon
any skeptic, not merely to reject the later authorities, but also
to provide a more satisfactory explanation of Herodotus.</p>

<p>If this series of conclusions is accepted, we have an answer
to the question under consideration—the occasion of the term
τραγῳδοί. We must conclude that honoring Adrastus with
choruses either did not involve the giving of a prize or that the
prize was other than a goat. With the transfer to Dionysus, a
goat (for some reason) was chosen as the object of competition,
and was doubtless immediately consumed in a sacrificial feast.
We have seen that at Corinth, where the choreutae were satyrs,
there was no reason to coin a new term to designate them. But
at Sicyon the situation was different. What more natural than
that from the new prize should be derived new names (τραγικοὶ
χοροί and τραγῳδοί respectively) for the new-old performances
and their choreutae.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It is not enough to pass this tradition of
Sicyonian tragedy by in silence or to brand it as aetiological or as
arising from the partisanship of rival cities. It must first be
shown to be inconsistent, either with itself or with other
established facts.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have dealt with the Peloponnesus, which was
inhabited by the Dorian branch of the Greek stock; at this point
we pass to Attica, which was Ionic. We are indebted to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
late Professor Furtwängler (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 22 ff.) for having pointed
out that among the Dorians the attendant sprites of Dionysus
were caprine satyrs, but that among the Ionians he was attended
by sileni, creatures with equine ears, hoofs, and tails. Caprine
satyrs do not appear upon Attic vases until about 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (see
<a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>, below). Although the sort of dances from which tragedy
developed had existed in Attica from time immemorial,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> yet
they did not emerge into prominence and literary importance
until the age of Thespis and in Icaria. Evidently Thespis’
innovations were partly borrowed from the Peloponnesus and
partly his own. Included among the former would be the dropping
of improvisation, the use of meter, the goat prize, and such
terms as δρᾶμα and τραγῳδός. Most distinctive among the latter
was his invention of the first actor. In early choral performances
it was customary for the poet himself to serve as coryphaeus,
and in Bacchylides’ dithyramb we have seen how the coryphaeus
was set apart from the other choreutae, answering the questions
which they propounded. It was inevitable that to someone
should come the happy thought of developing this rôle still
further and of promoting the coryphaeus to a position independent
of the chorus. It is significant that the verb which was
first used to designate the actor’s function was ἀποκρίνεσθαι
(“to answer”), and that until the time of Sophocles all playwrights
were actors in their own productions. We are now in a
position to realize the true inwardness of Aristotle’s phrase: he
does not say merely that tragedy was derived from the dithyramb
but from the “leaders” of the dithyramb.</p>

<p>We have noted that the early dithyramb did not require
impersonation (see <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>, above). Even at an advanced stage
it was probably much like a sacred oratorio of modern times in
which the performers may sing words which are appropriate to
characters and yet make no attempt by costume, gestures, or
actions to represent those characters. Thespis changed all this.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Since he assumed an actor’s rôle himself, first of all probably that
of Dionysus, the choreutae could no longer conduct themselves
as worshipers in disguise, but must now not merely look like
real attendants of Dionysus but also behave as such. This
is a fundamental matter. Only after this step had been taken
could real drama in the modern sense become possible. Neither
honoring the sorrows of Adrastus nor the “fore-doing” of imitative
magic, not even the primitive δρώμενα at Eleusis or elsewhere
demanded or presupposed actual impersonation. This development
took place at Icaria and by the agency of Thespis. I cannot
do better than to quote certain sentences of Miss Harrison’s:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We are apt to forget that from the <i>epos</i>, the narrative, to the <i>drama</i>, the
enactment, is a momentous step, one, so far as we know, not taken in Greece
till after centuries of epic achievement, and then taken suddenly, almost in
the dark, and irrevocably. All we really know of this momentous step is
that it was taken sometime in the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and taken in connection
with the worship of Dionysus. Surely it is at least possible that
the real impulse to the drama lay not wholly in “goat-songs” and “circular
dancing places” but also in the cardinal, the essentially dramatic, conviction
of the religion of Dionysus, that the worshipper can not only worship, but
can become, can <i>be</i>, his god. Athene and Zeus and Poseidon have no drama,
because no one, in his wildest moments, believed he could become and be
Athene or Zeus or Poseidon. It is indeed only in the orgiastic religions that
these splendid moments of conviction could come, and, for Greece at least,
only in an orgiastic religion did the drama take its rise.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thespis’ invention of impersonation probably provides the
clue for understanding the clash between him and Solon:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Thespis was already beginning to develop tragedy, and on account of
its novelty the matter was engaging general attention but had not yet been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
brought into a public contest. Now Solon, who by nature was fond of
hearing and learning, to a still greater extent in old age gave himself up to
leisurely amusement and even to conviviality and music. Therefore, he
went to see Thespis himself act, as was customary for the earlier poets.
And when the spectacle was over, Solon addressed him and inquired if he
had no sense of shame to lie so egregiously before so many. Moreover,
when Thespis said that it was no crime to say and enact such things in
sport, Solon struck the ground violently with his staff and said: “Yet if
we praise and honor this ‘sport’ under these circumstances, it will not be
long before we discover it in our contracts.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To so straightforward a man as Solon such a facile abandonment
of one’s own personality might well seem like barefaced lying,
and to augur and even encourage similar shuffling prevarications
in the more serious affairs of life.</p>

<p>To Ridgeway, however, all this appears in a different light.
In the first place, after citing Diogenes Laertius to the effect that
“in ancient times the chorus at first carried on the action in
tragedy alone, but later Thespis invented an actor in order to
allow the chorus intervals of relief,”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> he declares flatly: “But
this cannot mean, as is commonly held, that Thespis first separated
in some degree the coryphaeus from the chorus and made
him interrupt the dithyramb with epic recitations, for, as we
have seen above, before his time the poet or coryphaeus used to
mount a table and hold a dialogue with the chorus.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In the
cross-reference Ridgeway had quoted Pollux iv. 123: “The ἐλεός
was a table in the olden days upon which in the period before
Thespis some one mounted and made answer to the choreutae,”
and <i>Etymologicum Magnum</i>, <i>s.v.</i> “θυμέλη”: “It was a table upon
which they stood and sang in the country when tragedy had not
yet assumed definite form.” These late notices are manifestly
vague and inexact references to rudimentary histrionicism among
the choreutae themselves or between them and their coryphaeus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
The first of them is probably due to a false inference from a
scene in some comedy.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It is true that the invention of the
first actor is expressly attributed to Thespis only by Diogenes,
yet it may be inferred in several other connections. Evidently
the matter is largely one of definition. Ridgeway himself concedes
all that is important, when he continues: “There seems
no reason to doubt that Thespis in some way defined more
exactly the position of the actor, especially by the introduction
of a simple form of mask.”</p>

<p>In the second place, Ridgeway considers that Thespis made
the “grand step” in the evolution of tragedy when he</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">detached his chorus and dithyramb from some particular shrine, probably
at Icaria, his native place, and taking his company with him on wagons gave
his performances on his extemporised stage when and where he could find
an audience, not for religious purposes but for a pastime. Thus not merely
by defining more accurately the rôle of the actor but also by lifting tragedy
from being a mere piece of religious ritual tied to a particular spot into a
great form of literature, he was the true founder of the tragic art. This view
offers a reasonable explanation of Solon’s anger on first seeing Thespis act.
A performance which he would have regarded as fit and proper when enacted
in some shrine of the gods or at a hero’s tomb, not unnaturally roused his
indignation when the exhibition was merely “for sport,” as Thespis himself
said (and doubtless also for profit), and not at some hallowed spot, but in
any profane place where an audience might conveniently be collected [<i>op.
cit.</i>, p. 61].</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Not only does such an interpretation find no support in Plutarch’s
anecdote but it is highly improbable as well. It may be granted
that after long neglect Thespis’ “wagon”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> seems to be enjoying
a recrudescence of favor. Dieterich and von Wilamowitz have
referred to it in all seriousness.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> There is nothing improbable
about the tradition nor any compelling reason for supposing it
borrowed from the history of early comedy. It is natural to
suppose that Thespis did not restrict his activities to Icaria, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
extended them to such other demes as were interested or found
them appropriate to their festivals. In that case, means of
transportation for performers and accessories became imperative.
The use of such a vehicle in the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> of Aeschylus
shows that it need not necessarily have served also as a stage,
as has sometimes been thought. Now, as a matter of fact,
several Attic vases, dating from the close of the sixth century
B.C., represent the “wagon-ship” of Dionysus (<a href="#figure65">Fig. 65</a>). Just
what relationship subsisted between primitive drama and the
scenes depicted upon these vases has yet to be definitely established.
Dr. Frickenhaus would associate them with the preliminary
procession at the City Dionysia (see <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>, below).
But at least, until such time as any connection with Thespis’
wagon has been shown to be impossible, the suggestion can
scarcely be laughed out of court as utterly ridiculous. On the
other hand, to suppose that Thespis entirely dissociated his
performances from shrines and festivals not only rests upon no
evidence but is so out of harmony with other data as to be
incredible.</p>

<p>Whether the innovation of treating non-Dionysiac themes in
tragedy must also be credited to Thespis before he brought his
career to a close must remain a matter of doubt, though personally
I am inclined to suppose so. Suidas<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> reports <i>Phorbas or the
Prizes of Pelias</i>, <i>Priests</i>, <i>Youths</i>, and <i>Pentheus</i> as the titles of
four of his plays. Of these the last is clearly Dionysiac, the
first probably is not, and the other two are noncommittal. This
evidence, however, cannot be relied upon, for the reason that
Aristoxenus is said to have declared that Heraclides Ponticus
wrote tragedies and attributed them to Thespis.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But as we are not told that these plays bore the same titles as those
ascribed to Thespis by Suidas, it does not by any means follow that the
latter are spurious. But even if the titles were the same, it is not unlikely
that Heraclides would have chosen as titles for his spurious compositions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
names declared by tradition to be those of genuine works of the Father
of Attic Tragedy. The titles as they have reached us indicate that the
ancients most certainly did not believe that Thespis confined himself to
Dionysiac subjects.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In any case, this development could not have been long
deferred after 534 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> To the more conservative it is said to
have given offense; according to some authorities, the expression
“Nothing to do with Dionysus” took its rise at this juncture.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Simultaneously, or at least only a little subsequently, the tragic
choreutae were no longer dressed to represent sileni but whatever
the needs of the individual play demanded, often plain citizens
of Athens, Corinth, Thebes, etc.</p>

<p>Even after all that Thespis did for it tragedy must still have
been a crude, coarse, only semi-literary affair. Nevertheless, in
534 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when Pisistratus, tyrant of Athens, established a new
festival called the City Dionysia, in honor of Dionysus Eleuthereus,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
he made a contest in tragedy the chief feature of its
program. As was but fitting, Thespis won the first goat prize
ever awarded in this Athenian festival.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It is unnecessary to
enlarge upon this recognition except to protest against a not
uncommon tendency to assume that terms like τραγῳδία and
τραγῳδός were not in use before this date. Of course, the
matter can not be definitely proved, but the evolution which
I have been tracing at Sicyon and Icaria distinctly favors the
other view.</p>

<p>We have seen that Aristotle’s statements ought not to be
ignored or lightly rejected. On the other hand, it is no less
important to read nothing into his language which does not
belong there. Thus, when he declares: “Discarding short<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
stories and a ludicrous diction, through its passing out of its
satyric stage, tragedy assumed, though only at a late point in its
progress, a tone of dignity,”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the phrase διὰ τὸ ἐκ σατυρικοῦ
μεταβαλεῖν ὀψὲ ἀπεσεμνύνθη has generally been taken to mean
that tragedy developed out of a form like the satyric dramas
known to us, in the next century, from Sophocles’ <i>Trackers</i> and
Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i>. For such a historical development no other
testimony can be cited until Byzantine times (see <a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a> and <a href="#Footnote_55">n. 2</a>,
below). Now this interpretation of Aristotle’s phrase has always
involved certain difficulties and has been pronounced inconsistent
with his other statement that tragedy developed “from the
leaders of the dithyramb.” But in my opinion we must accept
Reisch’s interpretation: “We are certainly not warranted in
translating ἐκ σατυρικοῦ baldly as ‘from the satyr-play.’ On the
contrary, Aristotle is speaking only of the ‘satyr-play-like origin’
and of the ‘satyr-like poetry’ (as Theodor Gomperz suitably
renders it in his translation); and from this, first of all, only a
family relationship between primitive tragedy and the satyr-play,
not an identity, may be inferred.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The same thought
recurs in Aristotle’s next sentence, when he says: “The iambic
measure then replaced the trochaic tetrameter, which was
originally employed <i>when the poetry was of the satyric order</i>, and
had greater affinities with dancing.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In other words, though
early Attic tragedy never received the name of “satyric drama,”
and though its choreutae were probably sileni and not satyrs,
nevertheless, since the Thespian and pre-Thespian performances,
by reason of their obscenities, grotesque language, ludicrous and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
undignified tone, the predominance of choral odes, etc., bore a
certain resemblance to the contemporaneous exhibitions of
satyrs in the Peloponnesus and to Pratinas’ satyric drama in
Athens at a later period, it can truthfully be said that tragedy
had passed through a “satyric stage” and had had a “satyric”
tinge which it was slow to lose.</p>

<p>What, then, was the origin of the performance which in the
fifth century constituted the final member of tetralogies? Such
tetralogies cannot be made out for any playwright before
Aeschylus; and the number of plays attributed to Pratinas,
eighteen tragedies and thirty-two satyric dramas, throws
additional doubt upon the probability that the early poets were
required to present four plays together.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> We have thus far
considered three types of performances: the improvisational
dithyramb, which was still continued in rural and primitive
districts; the improved dithyramb (in 508 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> dithyrambic
choruses of men were added to the program of the City Dionysia
at Athens), and tragedy. The last two had by this time become
semi-literary types. Now we are expressly told, and there is no
reason to discredit the information, that Pratinas of Phlius in
the Peloponnesus was “the first to write satyr-plays.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The
general situation is clear. After tragedy had lost its exclusively
Bacchic themes and had considerably departed from its original
character, Pratinas endeavored to satisfy religious conservatism
by introducing a new manner of production, which came to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
called satyric drama. This was a combination of the dramatic
dithyramb of his native Phlius, which of course had developed
somewhat since the days of Arion and Epigenes, and of contemporary
Attic tragedy; and it had the merit of continuing,
at least for a while, the Dionysiac subjects which were so appropriate
to the god’s festival. It appears that at first satyr-plays
were brought out independently of tragedy and in greater
numbers, comparatively, than was afterward the case. But
about 501 B.C. the City Dionysia was reorganized: the goat
prize was abandoned; κῶμοι, i.e., the volunteer performances
from which comedy was later to develop, were added to the
program; and, in particular, the regulation was established that
each tragic poet must present three tragedies and one satyr-play
in a series. Pratinas is known to have competed against Aeschylus
about 499 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> His innovation doubtless fell somewhere
between the institution of the tragic contest in 534 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and the
reorganization of the festival program in 501 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, possibly about
515 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>There remains the difficult problem as to the appearance of
the choreutae in the satyric drama at different periods in Athens.
Fortunately the aspect of non-dramatic sileni and satyrs is fairly
certain. Already on the François vase, an amphora signed by
Clitias and Ergotimus and belonging to about 600-550 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
there are representations of three ithyphallic creatures with
equine ears, hoofs, and tails (<a href="#figure03">Fig. 3</a>).<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> An inscription ΣΙΛΕΝΟΙ
leaves no doubt as to the identity of the figures. Mr. A. B. Cook
lists six other inscribed vases from Attica which tell a similar
story.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> None of these seven vases, however, betrays any relationship
to the theater.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a list<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of fifteen Attic vases has been drawn
up on which goat-men appear. None of these antedates 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
so that it is clear that such figures did not go back to a remote
period in Athenian history. In fact, they can hardly be conceived
of as preceding Pratinas’ introduction of the satyric
drama toward the close of the sixth century. Unfortunately
none of these vases is inscribed, but the caprine ears, hoofs, horns,
and tails scarcely leave room for doubt that these creatures, like
similar figures of Hellenistic and Roman times, were known as
satyrs. With one possible exception (<a href="#figure09">Fig. 9</a>), which will be
discussed presently, these representations also have no direct
relationship to the theater. It would thus appear that from
first to last a clear distinction was drawn, outside the sphere of
theatrical influence, between the equine sileni and the caprine
satyrs.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the vases which may certainly be regarded as representing
scenes from satyric drama the best known and most pretentious
is a crater in Naples (<a href="#figure04">Fig. 4</a>).<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This and a crater at Deepdene
were painted about 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Somewhat earlier are another
crater at Deepdene, a dinos at Athens (Figs. <a href="#figure05">5</a> and <a href="#figure06">6</a>), and fragments
of two dinoi at Bonn (<a href="#figure07">Fig. 7</a>).<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The last three are derived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
from the same original. On the Naples crater preparations for
a satyr-play are being made in the presence of Dionysus and
Ariadne, who are seen in an affectionate embrace in the center
of the top row. The names of the figures are made known by
inscriptions in most cases but are not always significant. Just
beyond Ariadne, Love (Ἵμερος) hovers above an uninscribed actor
in women’s costume, whose mask is provided with a Scythian
cap. The next figure is Heracles (inscribed) and the next is
thought to be Silenus. Beyond Dionysus is an uninscribed actor
in royal costume. Except Love, all these figures carry masks
and constitute the histrionic personages in the drama. It has
been claimed with great plausibility that the play dealt with
Heracles’ exploits at Troy.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In that case the king is Laomedon
and the maiden is Hesione, his daughter, who was rescued from
the sea monster by Heracles. To the right of the dancing
choreutes in the lower row is the flute-player (Pronomus), who
will furnish the accompaniment for the lyrical portions of the
play; to the left is Demetrius with a roll in his hand, probably
the poet. The remaining twelve figures are probably choreutae
and bear more directly upon our present investigation. Most of
them carry masks, and they have human feet and no horns.
They resemble sileni in having long equine tails. The sole
resemblance to satyrs is found in the fact that nine of them wear
a shaggy covering about the loins, supposedly a goatskin. The
waistband upon the choreutes in the extreme upper left-hand
corner, however, resembles cloth trunks more than a skin. Yet
this divergence is probably to be explained as due to carelessness
or a whim on the part of the draftsman instead of to an
essential difference in material. This appears plainly from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
study of the other vases in this series, on which the loin-bands
resemble the trunks of the last-mentioned choreutes on the
Naples crater rather than the skins of his nine companions.
None the less, a multitude of short dashes on the waistbands in
one of the Bonn dinoi (<a href="#figure07">Fig. 7</a>) is plainly intended to characterize
them as skins, and the bands on the Deepdene craters are
“patterned in such a way as to suggest a fringed or shaggy edge.”
An illuminating side light upon the freedom which the painter
exercised is afforded by a comparison of the left-hand choreutae
in Figs. <a href="#figure06">6</a> and <a href="#figure07">7</a>. These are identical figures in different copies
of the same original; yet the shagginess of the loin-band is
clearly indicated in the one and entirely omitted in the other.
Moreover, the choreutes on the other dinos at Bonn seems to
wear no waistband at all!<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In conclusion, it will be observed
that, except for variations in the representation of the conventionalized
goatskin, the choreutae upon all these vases are
exactly alike:<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> they all have human feet, no horns, and equine
tails. It is evident that by 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> or a little earlier this type
had become standardized for theatrical purposes. That it
suffered no material modification thereafter appears from a
Pompeian mosaic (<a href="#figure08">Fig. 8</a>).<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is plain that this was the type of satyr which the unknown
source of the notice in <i>Etymologicum Magnum</i> had in mind when
attempting to explain the etymology of τραγῳδία: “... or
because the choruses generally consisted of satyrs whom they
called ‘goats’ in jest either <i>on account of the shagginess of their
bodies</i> or on account of their lasciviousness, for the animal is of
such a sort; or because the choreutae plaited their hair, imitating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the form of goats.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This passage has been used to support the
canonical doctrine that tragedy was the child of satyric drama
(see <a href="#Page_2">pp. 2</a> and <a href="#Page_22">22 f.</a>, above), but is far from adequate for that
purpose. The words after δασύτητα (“shagginess”) are often
ignored or even omitted. But it is necessary to interpret the
final phrase, “imitating the form of goats,” in terms of the
details stated in the context. So far as we are now concerned,
the only point of resemblance mentioned is their “shagginess.”
This and Horace’s expression about the tragic poet “stripping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
his satyrs” for the satyr-play<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> would be entirely suitable in
describing the choreutae on the Naples crater. Furthermore, it
will be noted that this explanation occurs only in a late Byzantine
notice and that no earlier source is mentioned. The only way
in which a respectable antiquity can be claimed, by means of
literary evidence, for this interpretation consists in maintaining
that it is implicit in Aristotle’s phrase ἐκ σατυρικοῦ μετέβαλεν.
But we have already seen (see <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>, above), that this expression
need not, and probably does not, support this view. The only
other passage which can be cited in this connection occurs in
three other Byzantine writers.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The conclusion is irresistible
that both the goat-men explanation of the word τραγῳδία and the
supposed development of tragedy from satyric drama are due to
“reconstructions” of literary history at an extremely late period.</p>

<p>Evidently this standard type of theatrical satyr took its
genesis from an amalgamation of the caprine satyrs and the
equine sileni. It is significant that in Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i> and
Sophocles’ <i>Trackers</i> Silenus is one of the characters and <i>is the
father of the chorus</i>. These satyr-plays were brought out in the
vicinity of 440 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The question now arises: Was this conventional
type the invention of Pratinas or did it develop later?
It will be remembered that in the list of fifteen fifth-century vases
from Attica on which representations of goat-men occur (see
<a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>, above), one was mentioned as having a possible connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
with the theater. The single exception is a crater in the British
Museum of about 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (<a href="#figure09">Fig. 9</a>).<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The larger design on the
same side of the vase represents the decking of Pandora, and it is
commonly thought that the two scenes belong together and are
derived from a satyr-play dealing with Pandora. However
that may be, the presence of a flute-player would seem to indicate
that at least <a href="#figure09">Fig. 9</a> is theatrical. If so, the choreutae are
not of the type which we have been studying, but true satyrs
with caprine hoofs, horns, and tails.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> About their loins they
wear trunks, which in three cases are painted black (to represent
a goatskin?) but in one case are left unpainted. Now from
Aeschylus’ satyric drama entitled <i>Prometheus the Fire-Kindler</i>
is preserved a line “O goat, you will mourn (lose) your beard,”
which was addressed by Prometheus to a satyr who wished to
kiss a flame and which has been used as proof that the choreutae
were caprine in appearance.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Again, in Sophocles’ <i>Trackers</i>
occur the words: “For though you are young with a flourishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
beard, you revel as a goat in the thistles.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Finally, in Euripides’
<i>Cyclops</i> the chorus speak of wandering about “with this
poor goatskin cloak.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Although these passages do not constitute
proof that the dramatic satyrs were of caprine appearance,
they gain considerably in point if we may suppose that
they were, and to that extent they confirm the evidence of the
British Museum crater.</p>

</div>

<p>Such, then, is the penultimate stage in the evolution of the
satyric chorus, and many authorities are content to stop here.
But there remains evidence for a still earlier stage. A British
Museum psykter by Duris (<a href="#figure10">Fig. 10</a>)<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> represents ten “choreutae”
and a herald, and a British Museum cylix by Brygus contains two
scenes, in one of which three “choreutae” are attacking Iris
before Dionysus and his altar and in the other Hermes and
Heracles are protecting Hera from four “choreutae.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> These
vases belong to about 480 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and the “choreutae” upon them
have human feet, no horns, no loin-bands, and equine ears and
tails. Reisch is undoubtedly correct in recognizing in these
scenes at least the indirect influence of the satyr-play.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Furthermore,
a similar figure appears upon a Würzburg cylix of about
500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (<a href="#figure11">Fig. 11</a>).<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> This bears the inscription ΣΑΤΡΥΒΣ, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
manifest mistake for σάτυρος. Here we have the earliest representation
of a satyr in Attica. And though it does not belong
to a theatrical scene, its divergence from contemporaneous
satyrs of the Peloponnesus and from Attic satyrs of a later
period can be explained only on the basis of the appearance of
the choreutae in contemporaneous satyr-plays. The Duris
psykter and the Brygus cylix show that this type did not at once
disappear.</p>

<p>To my mind the meaning of all this is fairly clear. When
Pratinas attempted to restore the Dionysiac element to contemporaneous
drama at Athens, he kept the Peloponnesian name
but did not venture to shock conservatives still further by
disclosing to their eyes creatures so foreign and strange as the
Dorian goat-men would have been. Accordingly, he transformed
his satyrs so as to approximate the sileni of native tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
After fifty or sixty years, however, satyric drama had become so
thoroughly at home in Athens that the experiment was tried of
imposing the Peloponnesian type unchanged upon the Attic
choruses. But the reaction could not and did not endure. In
two or three decades the final type had emerged, such as we see
it in the Naples crater. Except for the goatskin about the
loins, which is often highly conventionalized, the native sileni
are at every point victorious.</p>

<p>The Greeks were inordinately fond of associating every
invention or new literary genre with some one’s name as discoverer
(εὑρετής). In the case of tragedy the problem was
unusually complicated. In later years Arion, Epigenes, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Thespis all had their partisans. The last named is the one most
frequently mentioned, and strictly speaking this view is correct.
But more broadly considered, the question largely depends upon
the stage of development to which one is willing to apply the
word “tragedy.” To many moderns, with almost two and a
half millenniums of dramatic history as a background, Aeschylus
will seem the first tragic playwright. At least, in his hands
tragedy became for the first time real literature.</p>

<p>The foregoing treatment will show that I do not believe a
study of the origin of religion to be indispensable for a discussion
of the origin of Greek tragedy. Prior to Arion and Epigenes
there was nothing which the most fanciful could recognize as
akin to modern tragedy. After the work of Thespis and Aeschylus
no one can fail to note its presence. To trace, so far as we
may, the gradual unfolding of the new genre from a state of
nonexistence to a period of vigorous growth seems to me a
concrete problem and distinctly worth while. The songs and
dances from which tragedy and the satyr-play developed were
associated, <i>at the period when they became truly dramatic</i>, with the
worship of Dionysus, and <i>at that same period</i> Dionysus was as
truly a “god” (as distinct from a “hero”) as any that the Greeks
ever knew. To abandon these plain facts and others like them
in favor of vague theorizing on religious origins will never bring
us satisfactory results. Now, in his <i>Origin of Tragedy</i> Ridgeway,
who may serve as a protagonist of this method, recognized
only the satyr-play as Dionysiac in origin, and attempted to
dissociate tragedy and the dithyramb from that deity and to
derive them from ceremonies at the tombs of heroes, i.e., from
ancestor worship. I cannot conceive that many classical scholars
will believe him to have succeeded in this attempt. Ridgeway
evidently foresaw this and tried to forestall it by saying that
“as Dionysus himself had almost certainly once been only a
Thracian hero, even if it were true that Tragedy had risen from
his cult, its real ultimate origin would still be in the worship of
the dead” (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 93). What, then, was the point in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
conceding that satyric drama was Dionysiac in origin? In that
case the ultimate origins of tragedy and satyric drama must,
after all, have been identical, and the differences in their origins
must have consisted only of the minor divergencies in the final
stage of their development. In practice, how does this result
differ from the more usual procedure, which ignores the ultimate
sources and concentrates attention upon the last stage of development?
So far as I can see, it would differ only to the extent
that the underlying religion of both genres would now be understood
to be ancestor worship. But this distinction loses all
meaning, for the reason that in his last volume Ridgeway maintains
that “Vegetation, Corn, and Tree spirits, as well as those
of rocks, mountains, and rivers, and what are collectively termed
Totemistic beliefs,” fertility-rites, initiation-rites, mana, “the
worship of Demeter and almost<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> all other Greek deities” are
“not primary phenomena but merely secondary and dependent
on the primary belief in the immortality and durability of the
soul,” and consequently that tragedy and serious drama (being
everywhere associated with some form of religion) not only in
Greece but “wherever they are found under the sun have their
roots in the world-wide belief in the continued existence of the
soul after the death of the body.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> How much of truth there
may be in Ridgeway’s contention that ancestor worship is prior
to and the ultimate source of other forms of religion I shall not
stop to discuss. But the practical value of so universal a generalization
has been well expressed by another: “Even if it can be
shown that your far-off ancestor was an ape, it does not follow
that your father was an ape.”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In other words, in spite of any
resemblance which may have obtained between the ultimate
forms of Dionysiac worship and the true veneration of heroes, <i>at
the time when tragedy actually came into being</i> the existing differences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
between them were of much greater significance than any
alleged identity of origin in the far-distant past could have been.
If it were possible for Ridgeway to substantiate his first position,
viz., that tragedy arose <i>directly</i> from the worship of the hero
Adrastus at Sicyon, or the like, there would be some meaning in
his work. But his doctrine of <i>ultimate</i> derivation loses itself in
primeval darkness.</p>

<p class="tb" id="The_Origin_of_Comedy"><i>The Origin of Comedy.</i><a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>—The difficulty of this problem was
recognized as early as Aristotle:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Now the successive changes in tragedy and the persons who were
instrumental thereto have not passed into oblivion, but comedy did suffer
oblivion for the reason that it was not at first taken seriously. And a proof
of this is found in the fact that it was relatively late [viz., 486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>] before
the archon granted a chorus of comic performers; they used to be volunteers.
And comedy already had certain forms when the aforementioned comic
poets [i.e., Chionides and Magnes, the first comedians after official recognition
was granted] appear in the records. Who furnished it with “characters”
(πρόσωπα)<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> or prologues or number of actors and the like remains
unknown. Developing a regular plot was a Sicilian invention, but of the
Athenians the first to abandon the “iambic” or lampooning form and to
begin to fashion comprehensive themes and plots was Crates.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>But whatever uncertainties may obscure the various stages
in the history of comedy, fortunately there is little doubt as to
the source from which it came. Aristotle states that “comedy
also sprang from improvisations, originating with the leaders of
the phallic ceremonies,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which still survive as institutions in
many of our cities.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Mr. Cornford (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 37 ff.) finds
the best illustration of these ceremonies in the well-known
passage in Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i>, vss. 237 ff. Dicaeopolis
has just concluded a private peace with Sparta and prepares to
celebrate a festival of Dionysus on his country estate. He
marshals his meager procession as if it contained a multitude,
his daughter carries upon her head a sacred basket with the
implements of sacrifice, two slaves hold aloft a pole which is
surmounted by the phallic symbol, and Dicaeopolis himself
brings up the rear with a large pot in his arms, while the wife
and mother constitutes the watching throng. At vss. 246 ff. a
sacrifice is offered to the accompaniment of an invocation to
Dionysus. Finally Dicaeopolis re-forms his procession with
various coarse remarks and starts up a phallic ballad of an
obscene nature in honor of Phales, “mate of Dionysus and fellow-reveller”
(ξύγκωμε). The proceedings thus consist of a procession
to the place of sacrifice, the sacrifice itself, and the phallic
song or <i>comus</i> (κῶμος). The last is important for our present
purpose because comedy (κωμῳδία) etymologically means “comus-song”
(κῶμος + ᾠδή). Κῶμος denotes both a revel and the band of
masqueraders participating therein. The comus was the particular
type of phallic ceremony from which comedy developed.</p>

<p>The comus in Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i> is sung by Dicaeopolis
alone for the reason that the lack of suitable helpers compelled
him to act as both priest and congregation. But Cornford is
right (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 38 ff.) in recognizing this song as belonging to a
widely spread type in which the improvisations of one or more
leaders (ἐξάρχοντες) are interrupted at more or less regular
intervals by a recurrent chantey on the part of the chorus. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
this instance the song is not continued to a length natural to the
type, but is cut short by the real chorus of the play which has
been hiding but now bursts forth and stops proceedings with a
shower of stones. From the standpoint of contents Cornford
detects two elements in the comus: an invocation to the god to
attend his worshipers in their rites, and an improvisational
“iambic” element of obscene ribaldry, which often took the form
of satire directed against individuals by name (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 41).
These two elements exactly correspond to the double object of
all phallic ceremonies, which were both a “positive agent of
fertilization” and a “negative charm against evil spirits.” The
former result was obtained by the invocation of friendly powers;
as to the latter,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">the simplest of all methods of expelling such malign influences of any kind
is to abuse them with the most violent language. No distinction is drawn
between this and the custom of abusing, and even beating, the persons or
things which are to be rid of them, as a carpet is beaten for no fault of its
own, but to get the dust out of it.... There can be no doubt that the
element of invective and personal satire which distinguishes the Old Comedy
is directly descended from the magical abuse of the phallic procession, just
as its obscenity is due to the sexual magic; and it is likely that this ritual
justification was well known to an audience familiar with the phallic ceremony
itself [<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 49 f.].</p>

</div>

<p>It is possible to cite many examples of ritualistic scurrility
among the Greeks, such as that indulged in by the Eleusinian
procession as it approached “the bridge,” that of the riders upon
the carts on the Day of Pots (χόες) at the Anthesteria, that at the
Stenia festival, and many others. Sometimes these involved
physical violence as well as mere abuse, and this element (or the
threat of it) frequently recurs in Old Comedy. Perhaps the
most interesting parallel is afforded by Herodotus v. 82 f. In
the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, in order to avert a famine, the Epidaurians
set up wooden statues of Damia and Auxesia, goddesses of
fertility.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Somewhat later, the Aeginetans stole these images<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
and set them up in their own country; “they used to appease
them with sacrifices and female satiric choruses, appointing ten
men to furnish the choruses for each goddess; the choruses
abused no man but only the women of the country; the
Epidaurians also had the same rites.”</p>

<p>The comus frequently took the form of a company marching
from house to house to the music of a flute-player and rendering
a program of singing and dancing at every dwelling. From what
has already been said it will be understood that the improvisations
of the comus leaders would rarely redound to the credit of
the householders. These scurrilous attacks upon their neighbors
combined with other motives to induce the comus revelers to
assume disguises, which varied from year to year. Now,
according to the <i>Parian Chronicle</i>, comic choruses were the invention
of Susarion and were first performed at Icaria. This
doubtless means that Susarion transformed the ceremonies of an
old ritual procession in the country into a “stationary” performance
in an orchestra. The same authority informs us that this
innovation was introduced into Athens between 580 and 560 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
This notice must refer to the Lenaean festival, since the program
of the City Dionysia did not receive this addition until about
501 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> At both festivals the performances still continued for
some time to be called comuses (κῶμοι), comedy being a name of
later date, and were produced by “volunteers.” Five Attic vase
paintings of about 500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> depict comus revelers as cocks, birds,
or as riding upon horses, dolphins, or ostriches (Figs. <a href="#figure12">12-16</a>).<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
The state did not assume official supervision of comedy until
486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> at the City Dionysia and about 442 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> at the Lenaea.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Before we can proceed further, it will be necessary to consider
the nature of ancient comedy. In the time of Hadrian
the history of literary comedy at Athens was divided into three
periods, called Old, Middle, and New Comedy, respectively.
Old Comedy came to a close shortly after the beginning of the
fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Politics and scurrilous attacks upon
contemporaneous personages made up the bulk of its subject-matter.
Living men, such as Pericles, Socrates, Euripides, and
Cleon were represented by actors on the stage and were lampooned
with the utmost virulence. Sometimes their identity
was thinly disguised under a transparent pseudonym, but
oftentimes the very name of the victim was retained along with
the other marks of identification. Middle Comedy was a
transitional period of about half a century’s duration between
Old and New. It renounced the political and personal themes
of its forerunner and was largely given up to literary criticism,
parodies, and mythological travesty. New Comedy, in turn,
abandoned such subjects for the most part and devoted itself
to motives drawn from everyday life. Except for the occasional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
presence of the chorus, it does not greatly differ in structure,
theme, or technique from the comedy of manners today,
<i>mutatis mutandis</i>.</p>

  <p class="captionref"><a href="#Footnote_92">See p. 38, n. 2</a></p>
</div>

<p>For the study of origins, however, we must turn back to the
earliest type, Old Comedy, which is entirely unlike any present-day
genre. We are fortunate in possessing eleven complete
plays of Aristophanes, the chief poet of Old Comedy; and
though no two of them are exactly alike in the details of their
structure, yet the general outline is clear. The leading features
are as follows:<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>1. The <i>prologue</i> (πρόλογος) spoken by the actors and serving
both as an exposition and to set the action of the play in motion.</p>

<p>2. The <i>parodus</i> (πάρoδος), or entrance song of the chorus.
Originally this division must have been exclusively choral, but
by Aristophanes’ time it has been developed so as sometimes to
include lines spoken by actors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>3. The <i>agon</i> (ἀγών, “contest”), a “dramatized debate” or
verbal duel between two actors, each supported by a semi-chorus;
see <a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>, below.</p>

<p>4. The <i>parabasis</i> (from παραβαίνω, to “come forward”), a
“choral agon” in which the chorus, the actors being off stage,
march forward to address the audience. When complete, the
parabasis consists of seven parts which fall into two groups:
the first group contains three single parts, which were probably
rendered by the first coryphaeus. Dropping all dramatic
illusion and all connection with the preceding events of the play,
he sets forth the poet’s views concerning his own merits and
claims upon the public, ridicules the rival playwrights, announces
his opinions on civic questions, etc. The second group contains
four parts in the form of an epirrhematic syzygy, i.e., a <i>song</i>
(ᾠδή) and <i>epirrheme</i> (ἐπίῤῥημα, “speech”) by one semi-chorus
and its leader, respectively, are counterbalanced by an <i>antode</i>
(ἀντῳδή) and an <i>antepirrheme</i> (ἀντεπίῤῥημα) by the other semi-chorus
and its leader; here the chorus usually sing in character
once more, the knights praising their “horses,” the birds their
manner of life as compared with men’s, etc.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>5. There follows a series of <i>episodes</i> (ἐπεισόδια), histrionic
scenes separated (6) by brief <i>choral odes</i> (στάσιμα or χορικά).
The episodes portray the consequences of the victory won in the
agon (3). For example, in the <i>Acharnians</i> the subject of controversy
is whether Dicaeopolis shall be punished for the alleged
treason of having made a private peace with Sparta, and part
(5) represents him, in a succession of burlesque scenes, as enjoying
the fruits of that peace.</p>

<p>7. The <i>exodus</i> (ἔξοδος), or recessional of the chorus. Properly
speaking, this should contain only the final, retiring song<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of the chorus (the ἐξόδιον), but the term came to include the
histrionic passage just preceding it, also.</p>

<p>This is a very incomplete sketch of a highly complicated
subject, but it will suffice for present purposes.</p>

<p>Now in the scurrility of the primitive (non-literary) comus
Professor Navarre (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 248) would recognize three stages.
In the first, the ribaldry of the comus received no answer from
the crowd of spectators. This is doubtless to be explained by
supposing that all who were competent to participate were
already members of the comus; the spectators consisted only
of women and children, who frequently had no more right of
speech in religious ritual than in law. So Dicaeopolis’ wife is
present but speechless in Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i> (see <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>,
above). In the second stage, the bystanders retorted to the
assaults of the comus revelers. This probably indicates that
membership in the comus has been restricted in some way,
leaving others free to retaliate in kind from the crowd. The
third stage was reached when this new element was formally
recognized and brought within the comus itself, which was thus
divided into antagonistic halves for mutual recrimination.
Thus may be explained a peculiar feature of Old Comedy. Its
chorus was a double chorus of twenty-four members, always
divided into two semi-choruses, which often were hostile during
a large portion of the play. Sometimes this division between
them was shown by their masks or costumes, as when the chorus
represented men and women, horses and their riders, etc. But
sometimes the division was one of sentiment—one semi-chorus,
for example, favoring peace and the other being opposed to it.
The result of this division of the early comus revelers into semi-choruses
is a parallelism of structure in certain parts of comedy,
ode being matched by antode, and the epirrheme of one chorus
leader by the antepirrheme of the other. It is clear that all the
divisions which show this duality of arrangement descend from
the comus.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>One of these divisions is the parabasis (4). Though one of
the most ancient features of Old Comedy, it was also one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
first to decay: complete in Aristophanes’ earlier plays, it is
always mutilated in some way during his middle period and in
his last two comedies has disappeared entirely. We have seen
(<a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>, above) that the essential characteristics of the phallic
ceremonies were the induction of the good influences by invocation
and the aversion of the bad by vituperation. Now in the
epirrhematic syzygy which constituted the second half of the
parabasis, even as late as Aristophanes, when it naturally must
have changed considerably in function, “the ode and antode
normally contain an invocation, either of a muse or of gods, who
are invited to be present at the dance, the divine personages
being always selected with reference to the character of the
chorus. The epirrheme and antepirrheme often contain the
other element of satire or some milder form of advice and
exhortation.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Another division of Old Comedy which was carefully balanced
and which ought, therefore, to be a derivative of the comus is the
agon (3). Normally this division was epirrhematic in structure
and fell into nine parts, as follows: First comes the ode sung by
one half-chorus, then the <i>cataceleusmus</i> (κατακελευσμός, “encouragement”)
in which their leader exhorts one of the actor contestants,
thirdly this actor delivers his speech (epirrheme),
concluding with a peroration (πνῖγος, “choke,” so called because
it was all to be delivered in one breath and left the performer
speechless). Next came the antode, anticataceleusmus, antepirrheme,
and antipnigus rendered by the other half-chorus,
their leader, and the second actor, respectively. Finally, in
the <i>sphragis</i> (σφραγίς, “seal”) is given the unanimous verdict of
the whole chorus. At first glance it would seem that too
important a rôle is here played by actors for the agon ever to
have been derived from the comus, which was purely choral.
The comus consisted of an undifferentiated band of revelers
and its choreutae assumed no distinct parts. In fact, there is no
reason to suppose that their performances involved dramatic
impersonation (μίμησις) at all. They might be dressed to
represent birds or animals, but with few or no exceptions they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
sang and spoke and conducted themselves as would be appropriate
for men engaged in such a rite to do. As we have already
seen (<a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>, above) their costumes were for disguise.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the situation is not so impossible as it seems.
The fact that the masks and costumes of the choreutae were all
alike, or at most of two types to correspond to the two semi-choruses,
did not prevent each member of the chorus from
speaking, or singing, apart from the rest. This was sometimes
done even in fully developed tragedy, where the line of distinction
between chorus and actors was usually a sharp one. Thus, in
Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i>, vss. 1348 ff., each of the choreutae in
turn pronounces two iambic lines. In particular, the rôles of
the two chorus leaders must have been developed in the comus
and early comedy so as partly to compensate for the lack of
actors. Note that Aristotle does not state merely that comedy
sprang from phallic ceremonies but from the <i>leaders</i> (ἐξάρχοντες)
of the phallic ceremonies. An illustration of what may result
from participation in the action on the part of individual choreutae
is afforded by Aristophanes’ <i>Women in Council</i>. I believe
that the “First Woman” and the “Second Woman” who appear
in our editions as uttering brief remarks at the beginning of this
play are not actors but the leaders of the two half-choruses.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
In function they are not at first distinguishable from Praxagora.
Indeed, it does not transpire until later that Praxagora herself
is an actor, not the coryphaeus. The fact is that in all his
plays Aristophanes seems to have assigned his two chorus leaders
more extensive participation both in lyrics and in recitative than
has been generally recognized (cf. White, <i>op. cit., passim</i>). In
my opinion this sort of thing was even more common at an
earlier period, and in this way it was possible for the comus
to have a quasi-agon from which the later histrionic agon could
easily develop. Of course, the chorus leaders could not appear
in individualized rôles, as the actors did in the Aristophanic
agon, for characters had not yet been introduced into comedy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
but they could engage in a contest of perfectly general, depersonalized
billingsgate or, at a later period, speak as the poet’s
mouthpiece for the pros or cons of any question. Thus, they
would not represent individual men, with an individual’s name
and characterization, but <i>any</i> men. Their sentiments would
have been equally appropriate in the mouths of any of the other
choreutae.</p>

<p>The agon and parabasis must necessarily have been flanked
on either side by a processional and a recessional. In their
simplest form, these need not have involved more than silent
marching in and out again; but probably the flute accompaniment
was always present, and singing would soon be added.
Even when words and singing were employed, there was no
necessity of these being newly composed for each occasion or
even original at all. It will be remembered that in Aristophanes’
earliest and latest plays he did not write special exodia but borrowed
from earlier poets any popular airs that suited his purpose.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Moreover, Aristophanes’ exodi lack the balanced structure which
is characteristic of all divisions which descend directly from
the primitive comus; but in this instance that fact has no significance,
for the reason that by the end of a comedy (or comus)
the two half-choruses would always be reconciled and go
marching off together. Nevertheless, the intrusion of the histrionic
element, the comparative rarity of the earliest dramatic
meter (the trochaic tetrameter), and the absence of a canonical
structure make it plain that the recessional of the primitive
comus never developed into a regular division—in other words,
that the exodus of Aristophanic comedy was the product of a
later period.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Aristophanic parodus resembles the
agon and the parabasis in making a large use of the tetrameter
(<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 185). Moreover, it contains distinct survivals of
epirrhematic composition (<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 159 and 366), so that, in
spite of its histrionic elements and the absence of a canonical
form, the parodus ought to be considered as having been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
exclusively choral by origin and as having developed out of the
simple processional before the comus became histrionic.</p>

<p>The theatrical comus, then, must have been something as
follows: first a choral parodus, next a semi-histrionic agon, then
a parabasis, and finally a recessional which ultimately developed
into an exodus. A late notice,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> if correctly emended, informs us
that at one time comedies contained no more than three hundred
verses. I am of the opinion that this is the type of performance
alluded to and that comedy did not, in essence, greatly depart
therefrom until actors, as distinct from the chorus, were added.</p>

<p>How did this addition come to be made? It is impossible
that the comic playwrights, with the actors of tragedy ever
before them, should never have thought of taking this step.
Nevertheless, the main impulse seems to have come from another
direction. We have seen (<a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>, above) that in the non-theatrical
comus the phallus was borne on a pole in the ritual procession
with which the comus was originally associated; it was not worn.
Neither is it worn by the comus choreutae as represented on
Attic vase paintings (Figs. <a href="#figure12">12-16</a>). But in Old Comedy it is
clear that at least some of the characters wore the phallic emblem.
That this was in fact the general practice appears from the
language in which Aristophanes boasts of the modesty of his
<i>Clouds</i>:</p>

<p class="noindent">And Dr. Körte (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 66 ff.) has collected ten passages in
other plays of our poet which indicate that Aristophanes was
not always so puritanical as he claims to be here. These
conclusions are confirmed also by numerous representations, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Attic workmanship, which are plausibly thought to depict actors
in Old and Middle Comedy (Figs. <a href="#figure17">17-19</a>).<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> By the time of
New Comedy, on the contrary, the phallus was apparently no
longer worn, and the characters were garbed in the dress of
everyday life. Now the Dorian mime or farce was widely
cultivated in the Peloponnesus and Magna Graecia. The
performers were individualized actors, not welded into a chorus.
They wore the phallus, had their bodies stuffed out grotesquely
both in front and behind by means of copious padding, and in
general bear a very close resemblance to the comic actors at
Athens (Figs. <a href="#figure20">20</a> and <a href="#figure21">21</a>).<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Their performances were loosely
connected, burlesque scenes, abounding in stock characters and
enlivened by obscenity and ribald jests. Most authorities agree
that the burlesque episodes (5) of Old Comedy are derived from
this source. According to Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> the Megarians claimed that
comedy originated with them about 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> when a democracy
with its resultant freedom of speech was established among them.
It was even asserted that Susarion, the reputed founder of Attic
comedy (see <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>, above), came from Megara, but this claim is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
apparently unwarranted.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The fact remains, however, that
Aristophanes and his confrères often speak of stupid, vulgar
scenes or jokes as being “stolen from Megara.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Though these
words have been otherwise explained,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> I believe that Megara,
which is the nearest Dorian city to Attica, had something to do
with the introduction of the histrionic element into Attic comedy.
Of course, this does not mean that Megara is to be regarded as
the inventor of Athenian comedy, for the comus was indigenous
and received its development on Attic soil and the type of performance
which came into being after the introduction of actors
was quite unlike anything in Megara or any other part of the
Dorian world.</p>

<p>With actors, impersonation became possible for the first time
in Attic comedy. Besides the nondescript chorus and chorus
leaders, there were now performers who could assume the identity
of real or imaginary characters and carry a rôle or, by a change of
mask, several rôles through the play. The importance of all
this is too obvious to require amplification. It marked the
birth of dramatic comedy at Athens. Through the introduction
of actors, comedy became amenable to several other influences.
Tragedy could at once make itself felt. A histrionic prologue
could now be added, the comic prologue corresponding in length
and function to the tragic prologue and first episode combined.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
A real agon of actors now became possible, whatever use may have
been made previously of the chorus leaders for this purpose.
Furthermore, the new Megarian burlesque episodes (5) would
naturally be separated by stasima (6) in imitation of tragedy.
It would also be possible to insert an episode<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> between the parodus
and the agon, as is done in Aristophanes’ <i>Plutus</i>, vss. 322-486;
or between the agon and the parabasis, as in Aristophanes’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
<i>Knights</i>, vss. 461-97; or to compose a second parabasis and
to insert an additional episode between them, as in Aristophanes’
<i>Peace</i>, vss. 1039-1126, etc. In addition to all this, tragedy
would exert a constant influence in elevating and standardizing
all parts of comedy alike.</p>

<p>But the restricted and even disconnected method of elaboration
employed in earlier comedy, with its invective, lampoons,
and obscene jests, would not suffice to fill so ample a framework.
Therefore, it became necessary to broaden and deepen the
plots; in fact, now for the first time in Attic comedy was it
possible to have a plot worthy of the name. All this is implied
in the words which have already been quoted from Aristotle
(<a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>, above): “Developing a regular plot was a Sicilian invention,
but of the Athenians the first to abandon the ‘iambic’ or
lampooning form and to begin to fashion comprehensive themes
and plots (καθόλου ποιεῖν λόγους καὶ μύθους) was Crates.” The
reference in the first half of this sentence is to Epicharmus, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
name actually appears in Aristotle’s text at this point but without
grammatical construction. Epicharmus was a resident of
Megara Hyblaea in Sicily, whence he migrated to Syracuse about
485 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Like the Megarians on the Greek mainland, also the
Sicilian Megarians laid claim to the honor of having invented
comedy.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> They based their pretensions on the fact that Epicharmus
flourished and won his reputation before 486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, which was
the <i>terminus post quem</i> for the beginning of the official careers
of Magnes and Chionides, who were the first poets of state-supported
(as opposed to volunteer) comedy, at the City
Dionysia in Athens. Epicharmus raised the Dorian mime in
Sicily to literary importance, and seems to have improved upon
the detached or but loosely connected scenes of his predecessors
by stringing them together upon the thread of a common plot-interest.
His plays had no chorus and did not touch upon his
contemporaries or politics. Now Aristotle’s words concerning
Crates must certainly be understood as indicating a resemblance
between him and Epicharmus in at least some of these particulars.
The expression which I have translated “to fashion
comprehensive themes and plots” has been rendered “generalized
his themes and plots” by Butcher, “to frame stories of a general
and non-personal nature, in other words, Fables or Plots” by
Bywater, and “composed plots or fables of a ‘universal’
character” by Cornford (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 217). Whatever other
meaning may inhere in this phrase, I think that it must be taken
to mean, first of all, that Crates, like Epicharmus, made all or, at
least, most of the parts of his plays subservient to one connecting
idea or plot; and it seems to me that the previous clause which
refers to his abandonment of the “iambic” or lampooning form
looks in the same direction. In my opinion, the invective of his
predecessors had been episodic and unrelated to its context by
any sequence of thought, often being expressed in passages like
the following:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here this abuse is dragged in a propos of nothing, and the three
citizens who are assailed within a score of lines have no connection
with the main theme of the play. It was this sort of thing, I
venture to believe, that Crates discontinued; and Aristotle’s
language does not require us to conclude that he relinquished
scurrility altogether. It is usually thought, however, that Crates
made no assaults of any kind upon his contemporaries but
“generalized” his plots by treating imaginary, “ideal” characters
in his plays. In other words, he is supposed to have anticipated
to some extent the manner and material of New Comedy. I
have no desire to combat this view, which simply advances a
step beyond my own. The main fact, that of Crates’ having
invented plot sequence in Attic comedy, can hardly be made a
matter of dispute.</p>

<p>We are indebted to a late authority, Tzetzes, for the following
statements:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But also Old Comedy differs from itself [i.e., falls into two types], for
those who first established the institution of comedy in Attica (and they
were Susarion and his successors) used to bring on the characters (πρόσωπα)
in an undifferentiated crowd (ἀτάκτως), and laughter alone was the object
sought. But Cratinus [a contemporary of Crates], succeeding them, put a
stop to the confusion (ἀταξίαν) and set the characters (πρόσωπα) in comedy
for the first time at three; and he added profit to the pleasure of comedy,
lampooning the evildoers and chastising them with comedy as with a public
scourge. But even he still shared in the archaic qualities and, slightly, in
the confusion (ἀταξίας).<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Whatever the ultimate source of this notice, it contains much of
value. In the first place, a distinction is correctly drawn
between primitive comedy (Susarion to Cratinus; <i>ca.</i> 565 to <i>ca.</i>
450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and Old Comedy (450 to <i>ca.</i> 385 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). The earlier
period is marked by ἀταξία, which I refer to the practice of having
characterless choreutae take part singly as if they were actors
(see <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>, above). Though still occasionally guilty of this
practice, as even Aristophanes sometimes was, Cratinus regularly
withdrew his choreutae from participation in the dialogue
and reduced the performers to three. These three, however,
were now real actors, as distinct from the chorus and chorus
leaders, and played individualized rôles which demanded
dramatic impersonation. The number three was doubtless due
to contemporaneous tragedy in which the number of actors
had recently been increased by Sophocles from two to three
(see <a href="#Page_167">p. 167</a>, below).<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>A second difference between primitive comedy and Old
Comedy is found in the use which was made of invective. If
this development had not taken place, Old Comedy would not
occupy the unique place which it now holds in the dramatic
literature of the world. As we have just seen, the lampooning
of primitive comedy was probably episodic and detached from
the context, like that in Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i>, vss. 416-30; a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
whole play was not devoted to one person, and no citizen was
impersonated by an actor. Its object was merely to cause a
laugh and it rarely served any useful purpose, certainly none for
the public interests of the state. It was a natural outgrowth
of the magical abuse of the old phallic processions. Now Old
Comedy, on the whole, was just the reverse of this, and Cratinus
seems to have been the innovator who, “generalizing” his plots
by giving them a single theme, after the fashion set by Crates,
devoted them solely or mainly to political and social questions
and dragged his victims in person upon his stage.</p>

<p>When did these changes take place? First let it be noted
how they mutually depend one upon another: neither tragedy
nor the Sicilian mime could greatly influence early Attic comedy
until actors, as distinct from a chorus, were introduced, nor could
their influence be long delayed after the actors came. I think
that these factors came to fruition not long before 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><i>a</i>) Reverting to Aristotle’s words (quoted on <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>, above),
when are we to suppose that the Athenians began to “treat
comedy seriously”? The most obvious answer would be,
“486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when comedy first received official recognition.”
Chionides and Magnes are the poets of this period, and there is
no reason to believe that they improved upon their immediate
predecessors of the “volunteer” comedy otherwise than in a
more worthy literary treatment of their plays. Aristophanes
describes Magnes’ efforts in the following terms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All voices he uttered, all forms he assumed, the Lydian, the fig-piercing Fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Harp with its strings, the Bird with its wings, the Frog with its yellow-green dye.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is plain that these words refer to plays by Magnes which were
called <i>The Lydians</i>, <i>The Gall-Flies</i>, <i>The Harpists</i>, <i>The Birds</i>, and
<i>The Frogs</i>. These titles at once remind us of the animal masks
which were so common in the comus (Figs. <a href="#figure12">12-16</a>). Of course,
state supervision implies a certain amount of serious attention.
Nevertheless I think that in this passage Aristotle had a later
period in mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>It was long ago pointed out that Attic comedies were not
published before the time of Cratinus. The fact of publication
shows that comedy was at last being treated with true seriousness
and helps to explain the ignorance, in later times, with respect to
certain points. Though the state records gave the names of
comic victors from 486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> on, they did not include information
upon matters of mere technique. For knowledge of this sort
Aristotle (the ultimate source of Tzetzes) and all other ancient
investigators were almost entirely dependent upon what they
could glean from the editions of Cratinus, Crates, and their
successors. Now the earliest texts available revealed the use of
characters, prologues, and three actors as well as of the parodus,
agon, parabasis, and exodus. Why did Aristotle specifically
name the first group and not the second?</p>

<p>In my opinion, Professor Capps<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> has provided the correct
answer. He maintains that Aristotle distinguished two kinds
of ignorance concerning the history of comedy. In the first
place, there was the Egyptian darkness which covered the period
previous to 486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> For example, when Aristotle declared that
comedy “already had certain forms” (σχήματά τινα) at this time,
he could not have specified what these forms were; he was
merely surmising that the fact of state supervision presupposed
more or less definiteness of form. In the second place, there was
the period of semi-darkness immediately after 486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Tradition
must have placed in this period the introduction of characters,
prologues, and three actors, and so Aristotle singled them
out for mention. But tradition had not handed down also the
names of the innovators, and in the absence of texts it was
impossible to probe the matter further. Needless to state, the
situation regarding the other innovations, whether of this period
or earlier, was much worse.</p>

<p><i>b</i>) Though Thespis is said to have invented the prologue in
tragedy, this statement is justly discredited (see <a href="#Page_298">p. 298</a>, below);
and no tragedy is actually known to have had one before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Phrynichus’ <i>Phoenician Women</i> (476 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i>
(about 490 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and <i>Persians</i> (472 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) have none. It is
most unlikely that comedy should have anticipated tragedy in
this feature.</p>

<p><i>c</i>) Capps<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> has plausibly suggested that knowledge of Epicharmus’
achievements in comedy was brought to Athens by
Aeschylus, who is known to have been in Sicily <i>ca.</i> 476 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
shortly after 472 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and for about two years before his death
there in 456 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p><i>d</i>) The third actor was introduced into tragedy between
about 468 and 458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and it is more probable that the use of
three actors in comedy was borrowed from tragedy than vice
versa.</p>

<p><i>e</i>) Cratinus won his first victory at the City Dionysia of
452 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and (<i>f</i>) Crates at that of 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Doubtless the activity
of both men began somewhat earlier.</p>

<p><i>g</i>) It is incredible that the state should have postponed
official control of comedy at the Lenaean festival until about
442 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, if the developments which we have been sketching had
taken place long before.</p>

<p><i>h</i>) The earliest comedian to refer to Megarian comedy is
Ecphantides, whose first victory was won between 457 and 453
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Whenever Aristophanes “names any writers of ‘vulgar
comedy’ who used the stale antics which he repudiates, these
writers are his own predecessors and contemporaries of the
Attic stage.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> This implies that the borrowing was a fairly
recent occurrence.</p>

<p><i>i</i>) Finally, Megara was actually under the sway of Athens
during 460/59-446/45 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The opportunity for the exchange of
ideas between Megara and Athens would naturally be most
favorable at that time.</p>

<p>In view of the preceding considerations, I am of the opinion
that actors were introduced into Athenian comedy shortly
before 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p class="tb" id="The_Greek_Theater"><i>The Greek Theater.</i><a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>—Since, as we have seen, both tragedy and
comedy among the Greeks were choral by origin, the center of
their theaters was a circular “dancing place” called an <i>orchestra</i><a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
(ὀρχήστρα), in the middle of which stood a <i>thymele</i> (θυμέλη) or
“altar” (Figs. <a href="#figure22">22 f.</a>).<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> When an actor was added to the tragic
choreutae, it became necessary to provide a dressing-room where
he might change his mask and costume. This temporary structure
was called a σκηνή (“hut”: our English word “scene”), and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
at first stood outside the spectators’ range of vision. Afterward
it was brought immediately behind the orchestral circle and then
served also as a background in front of which the dramatic action
was performed. Its face was pierced by doors, usually three but
sometimes only one, which were conventionally thought of as
leading into as many different houses. The scene-building often
had two projecting side wings called <i>parascenia</i> (παρά, “beside” +
σκηνή). The front of the scene-building and of the parascenia
came to be decorated with a row of columns, the <i>proscenium</i>
(πρό, “before” + σκηνή). The top of this proscenium was used
by actors when they had occasion to speak from the housetop
or were thought of as standing upon some elevation. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
course of time it was employed also for divinities, especially in
epiphanies at the close of tragedies (see <a href="#Page_292">p. 292</a>, below). Since
this spot was never invaded by the singing or dancing of the
chorus and was the only place reserved for actors exclusively, it
came to be called the <i>logium</i> (λογεῖον, from λέγειν to “speak”) or
“speaking place.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Behind the logium was the second story of
the scene-building, known as the <i>episcenium</i> (ἐπισκήνιον; ἐπί,
“upon” + σκηνή); its front wall was pierced by one or more large
doorways. Past each parascenium a “side entrance” or <i>parodus</i>
(πάροδος; παρά, “beside” + ὁδός, “passage”) led into the orchestra.
These entrances were used by the audience before and after
the play, and during it by the actors (who could use also the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
doors in the scene-building) and the chorus. The parodi were
often framed by beautiful gateways (Figs. <a href="#figure51">51 f.</a>). The remainder
of the orchestral circle was surrounded by the auditorium, the
“theater” proper.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Chorus and actors stood on the same level
in the orchestra or in the space between it and the scene-building.
There was no stage in the Greek theaters until about the beginning
of the Christian era.</p>

<p>But when the Greek theaters came under Roman influence
and were provided with a stage, these technical terms naturally
acquired a somewhat different significance (Figs. <a href="#figure24">24</a> and <a href="#figure62">62-64</a>).<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The proscenium was still the columned wall in front of the scene-building,
but it now stood upon the stage (at the rear), and the
stage itself was the logium. Whenever theophanies required a
still higher level, this was furnished by the top of the proscenium,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
which was called the <i>theologium</i> (θεολογεῖον; θεός, “god” +
λογεῖον) or “speaking place of divinities.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The space beneath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the stage, or its front wall alone, was known as the <i>hyposcenium</i>
(ὑποσκήνιον; ὑπό, “beneath” + σκηνή).<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> There were now two
sets of parodi, leading upon the stage and into the orchestra
respectively. These two paragraphs are meant for purposes of
orientation and are written from the standpoint of one who
believes with Dörpfeld that in Greek theaters of the classical
period actors and chorus normally moved upon the same level.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>A Greek town could hardly be so small or so remote as not
to have its own theater and dramatic festival (Figs. <a href="#figure25">25</a> and <a href="#figure70">70 f.</a>).<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
The Greek theaters were regularly built upon a hillside and often
commanded an outlook over a scene of great natural beauty
and picturesqueness (Figs. <a href="#figure26">26-28</a>).<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> So far as such structures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
have come down to us, the oldest is the theater of Dionysus
Eleuthereus at Athens, and this is also the one of greatest interest
to us, for the reason that in it were produced practically all the
masterpieces of the greatest Greek dramatists (Figs. <a href="#figure01">1</a> and
<a href="#figure31">31-41</a>).<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> It seems strange that this building should not have
remained continuously known to men from ancient times until
the present hour, but in fact its very location passed into oblivion
for centuries. During mediaeval times and until well into the
modern era it was thought that the theater or odeum of Herodes
Atticus, a Roman structure of the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> and
situated at the opposite end of the Acropolis, represented the
Dionysiac theater of the classical period (<a href="#figure29">Fig. 29</a>).<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The correct
site was first pointed out by R. Chandler in 1765, and is clearly
indicated by a bronze coin of imperial times which shows the
relation subsisting between the theater of Dionysus and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Parthenon (Figs. <a href="#figure30">30 f.</a>).<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Excavations were conducted desultorily
from time to time, beginning in 1841, but were not completed
until the work under Dörpfeld’s direction in 1886, 1889,
and 1895.</p>

<p>The oldest structure in the precinct of Dionysus Eleuthereus
is the earlier temple (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>).<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> This was built in the sixth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, possibly in 534 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
when Pisistratus established the
tragic contest. Here was housed
the cult image of Dionysus which
had been brought from Eleutherae.</p>

<p>Somewhat later are the remains
of the early orchestra. According
to late notices,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> the original place
of holding theatrical performances
in Athens was an orchestra in the
old market place, the location of
which has not yet been determined.
At that period the audience sat
upon “wooden bleachers” (ἴκρια),
which are said<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> to have collapsed on the occasion of a contest
between Aeschylus, Pratinas, and Choerilus in the seventieth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
Olympiad (about 499 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). In consequence, a new theater was
constructed in the precinct of Dionysus, where the seats, though
still of wood, could be supported in part by the south slope of the
Acropolis. When the stone theater on this site was first brought
to light, it was erroneously supposed that this was the structure
which had been erected as a result of the accident just mentioned.
As a matter of fact, practically all that remains of the first
theater are certain fragments of the orchestra (Figs. <a href="#figure33">33 f.</a>).<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
These are sufficient to indicate that this orchestra was over
seventy-eight feet in diameter and stood nearly fifty feet farther
south than the later orchestra (Figs. <a href="#figure32">32</a> and <a href="#figure32a">32<i>a</i></a>).<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> As it receded
from the Acropolis it was banked up to a maximum of about six
and a half feet, leaving a declivity immediately behind it. The
extant plays of this period show that for about thirty years no
background of any kind stood in this declivity (see <a href="#Page_226">p. 226</a>, below).
Theatrical properties, such as a tomb, might be temporarily
built at the center or to one side of the orchestra. If dressing-rooms
were then provided for the actors and chorus they must
have stood some distance away. In the absence of a back scene,
the performers could enter only at the sides. These same
entrances were used also by the spectators in assembling. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
seats, being of wood until the fourth century, have left no trace;
but there can, of course, be no doubt of their position on the
slope. Well up the side an ancient road cut the auditorium into
an upper and lower section<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and permitted ingress and egress
for the audience at two additional points. The Athenian
theater was somewhat unusual in having these upper entrances.</p>

  <p class="captionref"><a href="#Footnote_137">See p. 65, n. 2</a></p>
</div>

<p>About 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, as the plays indicate,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> a wooden scene-building
was set up behind the orchestra, where the declivity
had been.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The front of this was probably pierced by three
doors, which might be conventionally thought of as leading to
as many different buildings, and thus the number of entrances
available for the actors’ use was more than doubled. This
seemingly simple alteration produced profound changes in
dramatic technique (see <a href="#Page_228">pp. 228-31</a>, below). The scene-building
of this period must be thought of as quite unpretentious: its
material was wood, it probably consisted of but a single story,
and I think it had neither parascenia nor a columned proscenium
(<a href="#figure74">Fig. 74</a>; see <a href="#Page_235">p. 235</a>, below). Its construction was flimsy enough
for it to be capable of being easily rebuilt or remodeled to meet
the scenic requirements of each drama, for of course it was not
until long after the introduction of a scenic background that the
plays were uniformly laid before a palace or temple. According
to Aristotle, Sophocles was the inventor of scene-painting, and
this is also said to have been invented during the lifetime of
Aeschylus.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> If these notices are correct, we must suppose that
scene-painting was invented in the decade ending in 458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and
so under theatrical conditions such as have just been described.
This would mean that at first the scenery must have been
attached directly to the scene-building itself and not inserted
between the intercolumniations of the proscenium columns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>The next building in the precinct seems to have been the
later temple, slightly south of the earlier one (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>). Its
substructure was of breccia (conglomerate), and its erection must
be assigned to about the last quarter of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
An image of Dionysus by Alcamenes found its home here.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the same material are the foundations of the parascenia
and of the front and back walls of the scene-building (<a href="#figure35">Fig. 35</a>),<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
and perhaps they are to be assigned to the same period as the
temple which has just been mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The superstructure
was still of wood, since the wide variation of scenic setting called
for a background which could readily be adapted to changing
needs. It is likely that the ten square holes in the rear foundation
wall (<a href="#figure38">Fig. 38</a>) were intended to receive the supporting beams
of such an adjustable structure.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Probably the scene-building
now rose to a second story, a supposition which is confirmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
use of the crane or μηχανή (“machine”) in the extant plays of this
period (see <a href="#Page_289">pp. 289</a> and <a href="#Page_292">292 f.</a>, below). At about the same time
a proscenium (also of wood) was erected before the parascenia
and the intermediate front of the scene-building (see <a href="#Page_235">pp. 235 f.</a>,
below), and painted panels of scenery could be fastened between
its intercolumniations. In my opinion, we must suppose that
such a proscenium stood far enough removed from the front of
the scene-building<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> so that, when there was no occasion to fill the
intercolumniations with panels, a porch or portico was automatically
produced (its floor probably raised a step or two above
the orchestra level), in which semi-interior scenes might be
enacted (see <a href="#Page_238">pp. 238 f.</a>, below). It has even been maintained
that a projecting vestibule was sometimes built out from the
center of the proscenium in order to provide additional space of a
semi-private sort (see <a href="#Page_236">pp. 236 f.</a>, below and <a href="#figure73">Fig. 73</a>). Of course,
no foundations for such a structure are found either at this period
or subsequently, for the reason that permanent foundations for
something which was only occasionally employed would have
been unsightly and in the way for the greater part of the time.
No fragments belonging to the orchestra of this period have been
discovered (see next paragraph and <a href="#Page_73">p. 73</a>). Moreover, the seating
arrangements belong to the Lycurgus theater of the next
century. Fortunately, however, there can be no doubt as to the
relative position of these parts: it is apparent that the whole
theater has been pushed some fifty feet farther north (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>),
and the causes of this alteration are not hard to guess. In the
first place, room was thus secured for the scene-building without
occupying the space immediately in front of the earlier temple of
Dionysus. In the second place, the slope of the Acropolis could
now be employed more extensively as a support for the seats of
the spectators. There are no means of determining whether
this slight change in site was made at this period or about 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
when the first scene-building was erected.</p>

<p>Slight as may seem the theater remains which have been
discussed up to this point, it must be noted before proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
that they entirely exhaust the field. There is not a stone outside
of Athens which can be assigned to any Greek theater before
400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Yet all the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides,
and all the extant comedies of Aristophanes, except two,
were performed before this date! In the latter half of the fourth
century Lycurgus, who was finance minister of Athens between
338 and 326 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, “completed”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> the theater which is reproduced
so clearly in Dörpfeld’s plan (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>) that it is unnecessary to
describe it at length. Most of the stone remains now upon the
site belong to this structure. So far as the auditorium is preserved,
its arrangements and furnishings are almost entirely
those of Lycurgus’ time. Most of the inclosing walls, the stone
thrones in the front row for the use of dignitaries, and the stone
seats for the rest of the audience all belong to this period
(<a href="#figure36">Fig. 36</a>). The only part of the present orchestra which goes
back to the fourth century is the gutter just inside the balustrade
(<a href="#figure37">Fig. 37</a>), but this is sufficient to show that the Lycurgus orchestra
was sixty-four feet and four inches in diameter or exactly sixty
Greek feet. This figure is significant as showing that the orchestra
was the starting-point in the measurements and not incidentally
derived from some other part of the theater. Behind the
orchestra and upon the old foundations was now erected a
scene-building of stone, one hundred and fifty-two feet in breadth
and twenty-one feet deep at its shallowest part. About its
parascenia stood a row of stone columns, from which it can be
estimated that the first story was about thirteen feet in height.
But the stone connecting columns which Dörpfeld restored before
the central part of the scene-building (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>) have been assailed
on every hand and have now been relinquished by their sponsor.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
This part of the proscenium was still of wood, for though the
scenic requirements by this time were fairly standardized for
each genre, the conventional setting for tragedy was quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
different from that for comedy or satyric drama. Furthermore,
the Greeks seem to have been slow to lose the notion that a
wooden background was necessary in order to secure the best
acoustic results.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> This wooden proscenium probably did not
stand so close to the scene-building as the drawing would indicate,
but formed a portico as in the Hellenistic theater (<a href="#figure38">Fig. 38</a>).
At the same time, or possibly at the close of the fifth century,
a colonnade was built just behind the scene-building as a place
of refuge from heat and sudden showers. There are two considerations
which make the Lycurgus theater highly important
to us: in the first place, here were produced the plays of the
Greek New Comedy which furnished the originals of Plautus’
and Terence’s Latin plays and which has partially been restored
to us by the recent discovery of large fragments of Menander’s
comedies; and in the second place this fourth-century structure
probably reproduced in stone the main outlines of the earlier
theater in which the later tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides
and all the plays of Aristophanes were performed. This supposition
is strengthened by the fact that the extant fifth-century
dramas could readily be “staged” in the Lycurgus theater.</p>

<p>Further alterations were made in the Athenian theater
during the first or second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (<a href="#figure38">Fig. 38</a>).<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> So far as can
now be established, this Hellenistic theater differed from its
immediate predecessor only in two particulars. The front of the
parascenia was moved back about six and a quarter feet,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the
parodi being thereby enlarged to the same extent. What
advantage was gained by this alteration has not yet been discovered.
The other change consisted in the erection, at last,
of a stone proscenium, about thirteen feet in height, between
the parascenia and about six and a half feet in front of the
central fore wall of the scene-building. At Epidaurus, Eretria,
Delos, etc., the supports of the proscenium were only half-columns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and sometimes they had grooves or rims running vertically
along their sides or had the rear half of the column cut into
an oblong for the purpose of providing a firmer fastening for the
painted panels (πίνακες) in the intercolumniations (<a href="#figure72">Fig. 72</a>).
But at Athens the proscenium columns were whole and were not
equipped with any of these devices.</p>

</div>

<p>We have already passed far beyond the time when masterpieces
of Greek drama were receiving their premier performances
in the Athenian theater; after the third century the dramatic
productions in Attica were no longer of consequence. Yet for
the sake of completeness it will be necessary to record briefly
two later periods in the history of this structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>The result of the earlier of these remodelments is commonly
known as Nero’s theater, for the reason that its façade originally
bore an inscription of dedication to Dionysus and Nero. The
motive for the alteration and dedication is doubtless to be found
in the Emperor’s visit to Greece and “artistic” triumphs there in
67 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> Under the circumstances it is not surprising that two
features of Roman theaters were now for the first time introduced
into Athens: a stage was built before the scene-building, and
the hitherto full orb of the orchestral circle was thereby infringed
upon. At the back of the stage rose a new proscenium, probably
no longer in the form of a straight and simple colonnade but an
elaborate façade with projecting and receding members, such as
was common in the Roman and Graeco-Roman theaters (Figs.
<a href="#figure40">40</a> and <a href="#figure59">59</a>). The depth of the stage cannot be exactly determined,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
but its front wall is usually thought to have coincided
with that of the stage now standing, which belongs to the next
period. But we shall presently find reasons for believing that,
though the Nero stage was deeper than the Hellenistic proscenium,
it was shallower than the later (Phaedrus) stage (see
<a href="#Page_75">pp. 75</a> and <a href="#Page_99">99</a>, below). Space would thus be left for the parodi
still to lead directly into the orchestra. Dörpfeld first estimated
the height of the Neronian stage at about four feet nine and a
half inches (see next paragraph), but is now inclined to think
that it belonged to the high Graeco-Roman type.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> In my
judgment, however, his earlier position is to be preferred. I
consider it probable that stone steps led from the orchestra to
the center of the stage, as in the Phaedrus theater (<a href="#figure40">Fig. 40</a>).
Just outside the gutter of the Lycurgus theater was erected a
marble balustrade (<a href="#figure39">Fig. 39</a>),<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> which stood about three and a half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
feet above the orchestra level and protected the spectators from
accident when gladiatorial combats (another Roman institution)
or the like were being exhibited in the orchestra. In order to
compensate for the curtailment of the orchestra by the stage,
the gutter, which had been left open except opposite the vertical
aisles of the auditorium, was covered over, except for occasional
rosette-shaped openings. Up to this time the orchestra seems
to have had no covering but hard-pressed earth, but it was now
paved with marble slabs. In the middle of the pavement is a
rhomboid design (<a href="#figure40">Fig. 40</a>), and in its central block is a depression
about twenty inches in diameter, by means of which an altar of
Dionysus (the thymele) was doubtless held in place.</p>

<p>The final alterations in the Athenian theater (<a href="#figure40">Fig. 40</a>)<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> were
made in the third or fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> by Phaedrus, governor of
Attica (Ἀτθίδος ἀρχός), who dedicated the “platform of the
theater” (βῆμα θεήτρου) to Dionysus in an inscription which still
stands on the uppermost of the stone steps leading from the
orchestra to the stage. The gutter was now filled up with earth
and refuse, and the rosette-shaped openings in its covering were
carefully closed. Plaster was used as needed, and the balustrade
and the front wall of the stage (the hyposcenium) were reinforced
and made water-tight by supporting walls. The intention was
plainly to enable the orchestra to be flooded for the representation
of mimic sea fights. The stage was partially rebuilt
and was lowered. The hyposcenium was adorned with a frieze
(Figs. <a href="#figure39">39</a> and <a href="#figure41">41</a>),<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> the extant portion of which is interrupted at
three points by two blank spaces and a recess. The latter is
filled by a kneeling Silenus. It is clear that the frieze had been
used before and that its slabs had originally been placed in
immediate juxtaposition. Moreover, the heads of the figures
have been cut away, so that the frieze, when complete, must have
been about half a foot higher than at present. The Phaedrus
stage is four feet three and a half inches high; and as Dörpfeld
was originally inclined to believe that this same frieze had at
first stood before the Neronian stage, he estimated the height of
the latter at about four feet nine and a half inches. In my
opinion, this estimate ought to be retained. But though Dörpfeld
now considers the Nero stage to have been higher than this,
he has not indicated whether he still believes its front wall to
have been the original position of the frieze.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that after the lapse of two centuries or
more the Neronian stage was perhaps in need of repair or renewal
and that the changes for which Phaedrus was responsible are
thus to be explained. However that may be, other influences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
were plainly at work. I think that at this period the Athenian
theater was at last thoroughly Romanized. That is to say, I
think that the Nero stage did not project so far into the orchestra
(see <a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>, above), but was now enlarged so as to accommodate
all the performances, and that at the same time the Roman
custom of placing seats in the orchestra was for the first time
introduced into Athens. But in order that the orchestra might
find occasional continuance of its function as a place of exhibition,
or possibly because of interest in the sport per se, all
openings were closed up and the old dancing place was made
capable of being flooded. It follows that the parodi no longer
debouched into the orchestra but led to steps at either side of
the stage, as shown in <a href="#figure40">Fig. 40</a>. The participants in the mimic
sea fights and gladiatorial combats and the spectators at other
performances could enter the orchestra only by passing over the
stage and down the front steps. Of course, the presence of
spectators so close to the performers would permit no type of
stage except one of moderate height; evidently even the low
Nero stage was a little too high under these conditions.</p>

</div>

<p>The foregoing account of the Athenian theater is founded, in
the main, upon Dörpfeld’s conclusions, but the reader needs to
be warned that not all of his conclusions are acceptable to
everyone. Until about half a century ago our information
concerning Greek theaters was largely restricted to literary
tradition. There was no theater of the earlier Greek types above
ground, and even the exact location of the Athenian theater had
been, during many centuries, forgotten. The literary tradition
was mainly derived from Vitruvius, a Roman architect at the
beginning of the Christian era, who devoted two chapters of
Book V in his work <i>On Architecture</i> to a description of Greek
and Roman theaters. According to him, the front and back
walls of the Roman stage were determined by the diameter of
the orchestral circle and one side of an inscribed equilateral
triangle; in other words, its depth would be one-half the radius
of the orchestra (<a href="#figure42">Fig. 42</a>).<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Its height was not to exceed five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
feet,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> since all the performers stood on the stage and the unelevated
front half of the orchestral circle was reserved for the seats
of senators. In the Greek theater, on the other hand, Vitruvius
asserted that the front wall of the stage was marked by one side
of an inscribed square, and its back wall, which he calls the
<i>scaenae frons</i>, by the parallel tangent, its depth being thus about
three-tenths of the radius (<a href="#figure43">Fig. 43</a>).<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Its height was to range
between ten and twelve feet. Vitruvius expressly states that
this stage in the Greek theater was called a logium, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
tragic and comic actors performed <i>in scaena</i><a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and the “other
artists” <i>per orchestram</i>, and that for this reason the Greeks drew
a distinction between the adjectives “scenic” and “thymelic” as
applied to performances and performers.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The differences
between the two types of structure are obvious: (1) the
auditorium and orchestra in Vitruvius’ Roman theater occupied
exactly a semicircumference, in his Greek theater distinctly
more than this; (2) the Roman stage was deep and low, the
Greek high and comparatively shallow; (3) in the Greek theater
both orchestra and stage were employed (separately) by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
different forms of entertainment; in the Roman theater all performers
stood on the stage and the semicircular orchestra was
occupied by the seats of senators.</p>

<p>Moreover, Pollux (second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) states that in the
Greek theater “the σκηνή belongs to the actors and the orchestra
to the chorus.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Everyone used to think (and some still do)
that σκηνή here signified “stage” and that Vitruvius’ reference to
<i>scaenici</i> and <i>thymelici</i> was to be interpreted in a similar fashion.
Accordingly, it was supposed that Greek actors performed
(and had always performed) upon a ten- or twelve-foot Vitruvian
stage and the dramatic chorus in the orchestra below. Confirmation
was found for this theory in Pollux’ further mention of
ladders rising from the orchestra to the σκηνή.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The use of both
orchestra and stage is mentioned a few times also in scholia
(ancient commentaries) upon the Greek plays. The possibility
of other interpretations of these passages will be considered
later (see <a href="#Page_97">pp. 97 ff.</a>, below). For the present this should be said:
We are interested in the Greek theater mainly because of Aeschylus,
Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes, all of whom lived
in the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and Pollux and Vitruvius, who flourished
many centuries later, nowhere assert that they are attempting
to describe the theater of this earlier period. Nevertheless, this
initial assumption used tacitly to be taken for granted, and these
Procrustean conditions were arbitrarily imposed upon the extant
Greek dramas by all editors and commentators alike. As a
matter of fact, such a difference of level between orchestra and
stage, chorus and actors, with no convenient connection between
the two, presented an insuperable obstacle to the (imaginary)
“staging” of the fifth-century plays. Various expedients were
proposed to evade the difficulty. One of the most popular was
that of G. Hermann, who in 1833 suggested that the Greek
orchestra was covered with a wooden platform to within a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
feet of the stage level and that thus a more intimate connection
between the two was established, and Wieseler (1847) proposed
to identify this platform with the thymele. Nonsensical as this
suggestion appears to everyone without exception now, it enjoyed
a tremendous vogue for some time. In the eighties the news
began to seep through to Western Europe and this country that
Dörpfeld had evolved a new theory, to the effect that actors and
chorus had performed in the orchestra on the same level until
Roman times.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Again, Mr. A. E. Haigh (1889) maintained that
a low stage was employed uninterruptedly until the fourth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when a high Vitruvian stage was introduced.
Dr. Bethe (1896) contends that at first actors and chorus performed
in the orchestra but that about 427 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> a low stage was
introduced, which in the fourth century was raised to the
Vitruvian level. On the other hand, Dr. Puchstein (1901),
who stated in his Preface that he ignored the literary evidence,
argued for a Vitruvian stage already in the fifth century. And
now Professor Fiechter (1914) has given his adherence to Bethe’s
hypothesis that a low stage at the end of the fifth century was
raised to a high one in the fourth. It will be seen that all
authorities are in substantial agreement that the Greek theater
had a stage, even a high Vitruvian stage, but they are hopelessly
divided with regard to the important detail as to when this stage
was introduced—at the very first, at the close of the fifth century,
in the time of Lycurgus, in the Hellenistic period, or in the reign
of Nero.</p>

<p>But before taking up the question of the stage in the Greek
theater, it will first be necessary to determine Vitruvius’ relationship
to the matter. The Roman architect’s description of
the Roman theater does not coincide precisely with any extant
Roman theater. Nevertheless, there has never been any doubt
as to the general type of structure which he had in mind. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
evident, however, that he is describing no particular, actually
existent, theater but is giving directions for an ideal structure.
Indeed, he declares: “Whoever wishes to use these directions
will render the perfect qualities of theaters faultless.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> There
is, therefore, no reason to expect that his directions for Greek
theaters would agree any more closely with any extant Greek
theater, and in fact they do not. During the last two decades
of the nineteenth century the ancient theaters at Epidaurus,
Oropus, Thoricus, Eretria, Sicyon, Megalopolis, Delos, Assus,
Pergamum, etc., were unearthed. The first result of this activity
was to show that no two of these structures were entirely alike
and that none exactly corresponded to Vitruvius’ directions.
Furthermore, it has become evident that all ancient theaters
are no longer to be classified under the two general Vitruvian
types, “Greek” and “Roman,” but rather under a larger number
of categories according to time, place, and conditions of use.
But the question which one of these types Vitruvius had in
mind still remains, and unfortunately the answer has not been
so clear as to compel everyone’s acceptance. In Vitruvius’ day
many Hellenistic, stageless theaters were still standing, and the
modern attempt to identify these with Vitruvius’ Greek type
and to force them into conformity with his prescriptions has
wrought great confusion in the field of scenic antiquities. But
Vitruvius nowhere professes to be writing a <i>history</i> of Greek
theaters nor had he any intention of presenting antiquarian lore.
His book was planned for distinctly practical purposes. Now
in his day only two kinds of new theaters were being erected, the
Roman and what Dörpfeld has christened the Graeco-Roman.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
Dörpfeld supposes the latter type to have originated with the
theater which Pompey had built in Rome in 55 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> This is
said to have been modeled upon the Greek theater at Mitylene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
in the island of Lesbos,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and Dörpfeld supposes that the orchestra
of Pompey’s theater was kept free of seats, after the Greek
fashion, and devoted to thymelic performances, but that the
top of the proscenium, despite its height and narrowness, was
converted into a stage, to which, according to Roman practice,
the comic and tragic actors were now elevated. However this
may be, the fact remains that from about this time theaters of
this type were so extensively built or created by a remodeling
of Hellenistic theaters that they became the only rivals of purely
Roman structures. Such theaters are found in the Nero theater
at Athens (according to Dörpfeld’s present but questionable
view), Pompeii, Segesta, Syracuse, Taormina, and extensively
in Asia Minor. Early in the nineteenth century Schönborn and
Wieseler correctly recognized buildings of this type as representing
Vitruvius’ Greek theater.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> But later on, when the earlier
Greek theaters were revealed by new excavations at Athens and
elsewhere, an attempt was made to identify these with Vitruvius’
Greek type. Dörpfeld himself fell into this error and in <i>Das
griechische Theater</i> maintained that Vitruvius had misunderstood
the function of the Hellenistic proscenium, interpreting as a
stage what in fact was only a background. But though Dörpfeld
thus incurred a large share of blame for confusing the
situation, he soon came to recognize his error and frankly
recanted.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Unhappily the pro-stage writers still persist in it.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that Vitruvius’ Greek theater could
readily be identified by comparing his directions for the height
and depth of the stage with the actual measurements of various
Greek theaters. Dörpfeld and Fiechter have both attempted
this but without any great success.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> For the sake of convenience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and clearness I have drawn up their figures in the form of tables.
Dörpfeld cited six Graeco-Roman structures as affirmative
arguments and two Hellenistic buildings as negative arguments.
Of course, the figures for the Hellenistic theaters refer to the
proscenium, in which some would recognize a stage. The
problem, therefore, is not merely as to what type of Greek theater
Vitruvius was describing, but the function of the proscenium
in Hellenistic theaters is also involved. On the other hand,
Fiechter, whose object is diametrically opposed to Dörpfeld’s,
cites four Hellenistic and six Graeco-Roman theaters as positive
and negative arguments respectively.</p>

<p>It will be observed that five theaters appear in both tables, and
that for three of them the figures do not altogether agree. This
is to be explained as due to differences in the manner of taking
the measurements. Thus, for Termessus, Fiechter gives for the
depth 4 m. (Dörpfeld’s figure) and 5.5 m. Similarly, for Ephesus
he gives 6 m. and 9 m., and explains that the former does not
include the socle projections. Evidently Fiechter still believes
that the <i>scaenae frons</i> in Vitruvius’ description of the Greek
theater ran behind the proscenium and did not include it (see
<a href="#Footnote_160">p. 76, n. 2</a>, above). The same difference of interpretation probably
accounts for 6 m. (Fiechter) and 3.50 m. (Dörpfeld) being
reported as the depth of the stage at Patara.</p>

<p>A similar opportunity for variance of measurement occurs
also in connection with the orchestra. In my opinion, Vitruvius
used this term in its broadest sense, viz., as including all the
space between the lowest tier of seats<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> (<a href="#figure43">Fig. 43</a>). Fiechter’s
measurement of the Hellenistic orchestra at Priene is given on
this basis. Sometimes, however, the term is used with reference
to the space bounded by the gutter.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Fiechter states that this
was his method in measuring the Hellenistic orchestras at Ephesus
and Delos. The discrepancy in the reports concerning the
orchestra at Termessus (9.90 m. and 11 m.) is also to be explained
thus.</p>

<p>But whatever allowance may be made for variations of this
sort, I think that whoever impartially examines these figures
with the expectation of obtaining a clear answer to the problem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
involved will be doomed to disappointment. Vitruvius’ Greek
stage should range between ten and twelve feet (Roman) in
height, or 2.959 m. and 3.55 m., respectively. Only one
Graeco-Roman stage and one Hellenistic proscenium in both
tables fall within these limits.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> On the other hand, though
Dörpfeld is clearly right in maintaining that the proscenia at
Eretria and Oropus are too shallow to accommodate the entire
histrionic action of a play, Fiechter makes it appear that Vitruvius’
rule that the stage of the Greek theater should be about
three-tenths of the orchestra radius in depth is satisfied more
closely by the Hellenistic proscenium than by the Graeco-Roman
stage. It should be emphasized, however, that he obtains this
result only by shifting the value of the word “orchestra,” taking
it now in the largest and now in a narrower sense.</p>

<p>Fiechter has tried to utilize Vitruvius’ diagram still further
by pointing out that in Vitruvius’ Greek theater the distance
from the center of the orchestra to the front wall of the stage
(the hyposcenium) plus the depth of the stage, i.e., the distance
from the center of the orchestra to the <i>scaenae frons</i>, ought to
equal one radius (<a href="#figure43">Fig. 43</a>). The figures in the first two columns
of his table apparently show that this condition is met by the
Hellenistic theaters and is not met by the Graeco-Roman
theaters. But here again we encounter a variable quantity
caused by a dispute as to whether the proscenium is to be counted
a part of the <i>scaenae frons</i> (see above). In the Patara theater the
distance from the center of the orchestra to the hyposcenium is
8.50 m. (14.50 m. - 6.00 m., Fiechter’s figures), and the depth of
the stage according to Dörpfeld, who measures from the proscenium,
is 3.50 m. Therefore, the total distance is 12 m. as
against a radius of 11.85 m. Again, in the Termessus theater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the distance from the center of the orchestra to the hyposcenium
is 7.10 m. (12.60 m. - 5.50 m., Fiechter’s figures), and the depth
of the stage is 4 m. according to Dörpfeld, measuring as before.
Therefore, the total distance is 11.10 m. as against a radius of
11 m. according to the largest (Vitruvian) measure of the orchestra.
These correspondences are close enough so as not to be
unworthy of comparison with those obtained by Fiechter.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the net result of the above must be the frank
recognition that such data concerning the Greek theaters as are
at present known to us do not afford convincing proof as to the
type which Vitruvius was describing. Nor need this conclusion
surprise us, if we accept Dörpfeld’s theory that Pompey’s
theater was the first example of the Graeco-Roman type. We
have no information concerning the Mitylene theater, upon
which Pompey’s building was modeled, nor concerning the
number or extent of its departures from that model. But any
theater in Asia Minor at that time must have belonged to the
Hellenistic type. Consequently, a certain resemblance between
Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman theaters was inevitable. If
Vitruvius was describing an old type, viz., the Hellenistic, its
variations in regard to the particulars just discussed must have
been too great for him to be able to find any single formula which
would comprehend them all, and he had to content himself with
recording a theoretical ideal. Or if he was describing a contemporaneous
but developing type, viz., the Graeco-Roman, we
must suppose that his authority was not sufficient to secure the
adoption of his rules by later architects.</p>

<p>Are we, then, unable to determine which type of Greek
theater was the subject of Vitruvius’ discussion? I think that
we can, but that we must depend upon other arguments. I
mention a few of the many which have been advanced: (<i>a</i>)
In the Hellenistic and earlier Greek theaters the orchestra, in
the narrowest sense (see <a href="#Footnote_173">p. 83, n. 2</a>, above), usually formed a
complete circle, or at least, if its boundary was not actually
continued into a complete circle, there was room for one without
infringing upon the proscenium. Examples of this are found at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
Epidaurus (<a href="#figure46">Fig. 46</a>), Athens (<a href="#figure38">Fig. 38</a>), Eretria (<a href="#figure53">Fig. 53</a>), Oropus
(<a href="#figure56">Fig. 56</a>), Magnesia, Piraeus, etc. Fiechter denies this (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 65), but only because he chooses to understand the word
“orchestra” in a larger sense. Now though Vitruvius used the
term in the largest sense (measured from the lowest seats, see
<a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>, above) he nowhere informs us what relative size the most
restricted orchestra should or might have as compared with
the largest space passing under that name.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> But his directions
require the stage to intrude so far upon his orchestra that it is
apparent that, if the same proportions were to be observed as in
the Hellenistic theaters, there could be no such full orchestra
with a smaller diameter. This is also true of Graeco-Roman
structures, and in this important respect they resemble Vitruvius’
Greek theater and the Hellenistic theaters do not.</p>

<p><i>b</i>) The logium of Graeco-Roman theaters is never supported
by columns along its front wall. The only exception to this
statement is found at Priene (Figs. <a href="#figure63">63 f.</a>), where the columns of the
Hellenistic proscenium were left standing when the theater was
remodeled. The reason why columns were not set in this place
is obvious—the floor of the Graeco-Roman stage naturally was
thought of as representing earth or a street and it was manifestly
improper for either to be supported on columns.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> On the
contrary, so fundamental an aesthetic principle would have been
violated if the actors had regularly appeared upon the top of the
Hellenistic proscenium. But there is no doubt that Vitruvius’
Greek theater had a stage for actors. It is, therefore, more
likely that this corresponds to the Graeco-Roman logium than
to the colonnade-like proscenium of the Hellenistic theaters.
Moreover, the columns of the Hellenistic proscenia were in some
cases unmistakably equipped to hold painted panels. But if
the actors had stood on top of the Hellenistic proscenium,
this scenery would have been beneath their feet and not behind
them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p><i>c</i>) Vitruvius discussed the <i>theatrum Latinum</i> in chapter 6 of
his fifth book and his <i>theatrum Graecorum</i> in chapter 7. The
former chapter is longer than the latter by more than a half, and
the latter begins with these words: “In the theaters of the Greeks
not all things are to be done in the same way” (as in the Roman
theaters). The implication is plain that some of the directions
in chapter 6 are to be understood as applying also to the Greek
theater of chapter 7, and of course the particulars involved
would be those which are not modified by the discussion in
chapter 7. One of these is the injunction that, for acoustic
reasons, the roof of the portico at the top of the auditorium shall
be of the same height as the scene-building (v. 6. 4). The
scene-building is never built so high as this in Hellenistic theaters,
but the rule is often observed in Graeco-Roman and purely
Roman theaters.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Dörpfeld has advanced several other arguments bearing upon
this problem,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> but in my opinion those just mentioned are
sufficient. Now if Vitruvius’ Greek theater is to be identified
with the Graeco-Roman structures dating from just before the
beginning of the Christian era, it becomes impossible to cite
Vitruvius in support of a stage or the use of the proscenium as a
stage in Greek theaters of Hellenistic or earlier times. It will
be necessary, therefore, to turn back to the fifth century and
examine without prejudice the conflicting claims with reference
to the presence or absence of a stage at that period. Our discussion
of the extant theatrical remains of that century has
already made it plain that there is nothing in them which can be
employed to prove that there was a stage for the exclusive use
of actors. But fortunately the paucity of such evidence is
compensated for by the preservation of forty-odd tragedies and
comedies of this period. A leading by-product of the stage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
controversy has been the recognition of the fact that these plays
are not only to be taken into consideration together with other
evidence but that they must be the final test of all theories based
on evidence drawn from other sources. If a given theory will
not permit these plays to be “staged” easily and naturally, that
theory <i>ipso facto</i> falls to the ground. As von Wilamowitz
wrote: “Von dem, was in den Stücken selbst steht, lässt sich
nichts abdingen.”<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Whatever judgment may ultimately be
formulated with respect to Dörpfeld’s contributions to scenic
antiquities, one of his principal achievements must ever be
recognized as the minute, searching, and unprejudiced re-examination
of the plays themselves which he provoked.</p>

<p>An illuminating exemplification of the use that may be made
of the plays in the study of such problems has been given by
Professor Edward Capps.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> He showed that if chorus and
actors be thought of as separated by a clearly marked line such
as the edge of a ten-foot stage would afford, the action of the
forty-four extant dramas requires the chorus alone to pass over
this boundary at least sixty-eight times, the chorus and actors
together nine times, and the actors alone thirty-nine times.
Actors and chorus are repeatedly brought into the closest possible
contact. For example, in Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i>,
vss. 1068-70, Iphigenia appeals to each member of the
chorus in turn, touching the hand of one and the chin and knees
of another, begging for their help.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span>—Movements of
  the Actors in Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i>, vss. 1-460</p>
</div>

<p>Again, the incidents of many plays come into harmony with
theatrical conditions only if we suppose that there was no stage.
Perhaps the best and clearest illustration of this is afforded
by Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i> (405 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Xanthias and Dionysus,
engaged in conversation, enter the orchestra at one of the side
entrances (<a href="#figure44">Fig. 44<i>A</i></a>). At vs. 35 the latter calls attention to
the nearest of the three doors in the proscenium, saying: “I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
already near this door where I must turn in.” It transpires
that this is the house of Heracles (<a href="#figure44">Fig. 44<i>B</i></a>), and Dionysus’
knock brings his brother in person to the door. From him they
receive directions for their trip to the lower world—that first
they will come to a large lake which they must cross in a tiny
boat, then they will see perjurers, thieves, and criminals of the
deepest dye, and finally will be received by happy bands of
initiates (the chorus), who “dwell alongside the very road at the
doors of Pluto” (vss. 162 f.). Scarcely have they left Heracles’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
door when they behold a trundle-boat pushed from the opposite
parodus into the orchestra (<i>CC′</i>) and hear Charon’s “Yo-heigh,
Yo-ho” (vs. 180). He approaches the edge of the orchestra
where they now stand, but when they prepare to embark Charon
refuses to receive a slave on board and poor Xanthias is ordered
to run around the lake (<i>C′C″D</i>; vs. 193). Meanwhile Dionysus
and Charon direct their boat across the orchestra (<i>C′D</i>) to
where, in the center of the front row of seats, the priest of Dionysus
and other functionaries always sat (<a href="#figure45">Fig. 45</a>);<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and from
behind the scenes, to accompany their rowing, the choreutae
sing a “frog” chorus as if from the bottom of the lake (vss. 209-69).
Upon disembarking (at <i>D</i>) Dionysus calls for his slave
and catches his faint reply as he comes into sight (!) from his
“arduous” trip around the orchestra’s semicircumference.
Xanthias now points out to his master the perjurers, etc., in
the nearby audience (vs. 275). Presently they are badly
frightened and Dionysus appeals to his priest, who is within
arm’s length of him, to protect him (vs. 297). Now the sound
of flutes is heard and the chorus of initiates enter. Dionysus
and Xanthias crouch down, where they are, to listen (vs. 315).
Immediately the orchestra, which has just been a subterranean
lake, is changed to the imagination into a flowery meadow
(vss. 326, 351, etc.). At vs. 431 Dionysus starts up from his
lurking-place and inquires of the chorus, “Could you tell us
where Pluto dwells hereabouts?” and the coryphaeus promptly
replies: “Know that you have come to the very door” (vs. 436).
Dionysus orders his slave to pick up the baggage, walks across
the orchestra (<i>DE</i>), and raps at the central door (<i>E</i>), which
represents the palace of Pluto (vss. 460 ff.). We need continue
no further, for the remainder of the play contains nothing that
is noteworthy for our present purpose; but it is already evident
how closely the successive situations of the comedy correspond
to the physical conditions and arrangements of a stageless
theater. To those who would apply Vitruvius’ account to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
fifth-century theater, this play presents ineluctable difficulties;
there is insufficient room for Charon’s boat on a Vitruvian or any
other kind of a Greek stage, Dionysus must appeal to his priest
who is some eighty feet away,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Xanthias has no lake to run
around, and Dionysus must inquire the way to Pluto’s palace
when he would be standing considerably nearer to it than the
chorus.</p>

</div>

<p>It was a convention in the earlier fifth-century plays that if
the chorus and one actor were before the audience, an incoming
actor should speak first to the chorus and ignore the other actor
for the time being (see <a href="#Page_165">pp. 165 f.</a>, below). This convention was
oftentimes extremely awkward and unnatural; but if both
actors had stood on a stage several feet above the chorus it
surely would have been altogether impossible.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>The only tangible argument for a stage of any height in the
fifth century is afforded by the occurrence of the words ἀναβαίνειν
(“to ascend”) in Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i> (vs. 732), <i>Knights</i>
(vs. 149), and <i>Wasps</i> (vs. 1342), and καταβαίνειν (“to descend”)
in his <i>Wasps</i> (vs. 1514) and <i>Women in Council</i> (vs. 1152). All
of these plays, except the last, were performed prior to Aristophanes’
<i>Frogs</i>, which we have already seen to be incapable of
presentation in a staged theater. In my opinion, then, these
words are best explained on the basis of the slight difference in
level between the orchestra and the floor of the proscenium
colonnade, which was probably elevated a step or two above the
orchestra and was often used by the dramatic performers
(see <a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>, above, and <a href="#Page_238">pp. 238 f.</a>, below).<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Since the <i>Acharnians</i>
was produced in 425 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the appearance of ἀναβαίνειν in that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
play is valuable as affording a <i>terminus ante quem</i> for the introduction
of a wooden proscenium at Athens.</p>

<p>The chorus of the fifth-century plays is fatal to any suggestion
of a Vitruvian stage, and except Puchstein, who frankly ignored
the literary evidence, no recent writer has advocated a high stage
for the theater of that period. The advocates of a high stage
have clearly seen that they can make headway only by the
sacrifice of the dramatic chorus. They are assisted in this
attempt by the fact that only three complete plays of the
fourth century are extant, the pseudo-Euripidean <i>Rhesus</i> and
two comedies of Aristophanes, and that the rôle of the chorus
in the latter happens to be curtailed. Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> also, speaks
of irrelevant <i>embolima</i> in the work of Agathon, who won his
first victory in 416 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> From these facts it has been declared
that at the close of the fifth century or early in the fourth the
chorus was either given up altogether or “its functions were
merely those of the modern band” or “of mere interlude-singers.”
Accordingly, it has been argued that the actors at the end of the
fifth century stood upon a low stage (which for the kind of plays
then exhibited was only less impracticable than a Vitruvian
stage) and that they were suddenly elevated to the full height
of the proscenium before the close of the fourth century. It
must be added that even among those who accept Dörpfeld’s
theory for the fifth century there is a tendency to go over to
Vitruvius for the period represented by the Lycurgus theater at
Athens and by the theater at Epidaurus—the last quarter of
the fourth century.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> So far as Vitruvius himself is involved in
this, the matter has already been disposed of. The alleged
disappearance or waning of the chorus, however, furnishes no
better ground of support for pro-stage writers. To trace the
history of the chorus in detail will not be feasible at this point.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
It will be sufficient to state that there is no reason to believe
that the tragic chorus failed to participate in the action or to
bear a respectable share of the spoken lines until Roman times.
Even in New Comedy, in which the chorus is now known to have
appeared only for the <i>entr’actes</i>, its on-coming is often used to
motivate the withdrawal of the actors. Such a motivation could
scarcely have become common if the actors stood so far above
the choreutae as to be safe from their drunken words and acts.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Another argument in favor of a stage has been drawn from
the phrases ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς and ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς, which occur in two
fourth-century authors, Aristotle and Demosthenes.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> It has
been claimed that ἐπί “naturally means ‘on’ and implies elevation”
and that σκηνή means “stage.” If this exegesis were
correct, there could be no doubt as to the presence of a stage in
the fourth-century theater; but as a matter of fact neither claim
is warranted. Everyone would concede that the primary,
untechnical meaning of σκηνή is “hut” or “tent,” and that the
word was applied to the scene-building, which was erected back
of the orchestra and which came to be increasingly substantial
in construction. Though the term acquired a variety of other
theatrical meanings, I agree with those who maintain that at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
no period did it mean “stage” in classical Greek. It is manifestly
impossible to discuss the matter here, but I shall presently
have occasion to show that even in Pollux, who lived in the second
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, it had not gained this meaning (see <a href="#Page_98">p. 98</a>, below).
If σκηνή does not mean “stage,” it is unnecessary to argue that
ἐπί does not mean “on,” for actors could speak from the porch
or from between the columns of the proscenium, and so could be
said to speak “from the scene-building” (ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς) or to be
standing “on the scene-building” (ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς) without being
“on top of the scene-building.” Just so the teachings of the
Stoic philosophers are referred to as οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς στοᾶς λόγοι<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
without any implication that the Stoics spoke from a platform,
let alone from the top of the stoa. Nevertheless, it is a fact
that ἐπί does not always mean “on.” For example, Diodorus
and Plutarch both employ ἐπὶ σκηνῆς in a non-technical sense
with reference to an occurrence “before” or “at the quarters”
of a commander. And Lucian’s metamorphosed ass was
mortified at being shown to be a thief and glutton “before his
master” (ἐπὶ τοῦ δεσπότου)<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>—surely there was no superposition
there. Such passages, however, come from later Greek, when
the prepositions were less clear-cut in meaning, and it is better,
as Professor Gildersleeve has suggested<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>, to “repose quietly on
the phraseological use of ἐπί; ‘on the playhouse side’ is all the
Dörpfeld theory demands.”</p>

<p>This being the theoretical situation with regard to the original
meaning of ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς, it is important to observe that already
in its fourth-century usage the phrase was employed vaguely,
often meaning little more than “in the theater” or “in a play.”
In fact, in one Aristotelian passage, as frequently in later writers,
it clearly includes both chorus and actors within its scope. “We
ought, therefore, to represent the marvelous in tragedy, but in
epic there is greater room for the improbable (by which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
marvelous is most often brought to pass) on account of our not
actually beholding the characters. For example, Achilles’
pursuit of Hector, if enacted in a play (ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς), would
appear absurd—the Greeks (οἱ μὲν) standing still instead of
joining in the pursuit and Achilles (ὁ δ’) motioning them back—but
in epic verse the absurdity escapes notice.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> It is evident
that Aristotle was thinking of Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> xxii, vss. 205 f.:
“But Achilles shook his head to the people in refusal and did not
permit them to cast their sharp weapons at Hector,” and was
trying to show why a scene that was excellent in an epic could
not be dramatized with success. In Homer there are two groups
of characters: (<i>a</i>) Achilles and Hector, and (<i>b</i>) the Greek army.
In Aristotle’s imaginary dramatization of the incident these
groups are represented by the actors (ὁ δέ) and the chorus (οἱ μέν),
respectively. Consequently, if σκηνή here means an elevated
stage, chorus as well as actors must have stood thereon. Nor
did the incongruity consist in the mere position of the chorus
inactive in the orchestra and the actors running on the stage,
but in the action itself, since the action is equally irrational in
the epic (where orchestra and stage assuredly play no part) but is
there more tolerable because the scene is not distinctly visualized.
I do not insist upon σκηνή here meaning “play” or “performance,”
though that is a frequent use and gives the indefinite
sense required; but at least until this passage can be shown
capable of another interpretation, believers in a stage cannot
fairly cite Aristotle’s use of ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς in support of their
opinion.</p>

<p>But though ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς σκηνῆς was broad enough to comprise
both chorus and actors, it naturally did not always include them
both. Particularly, if it were desired to distinguish between the
two kinds of dramatic performers, since οἱ ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς θυμέλης
could be used of the dithyrambic choruses and other “thymelic”
(i.e., orchestral) performers, and could not possibly be applied to
the actors, that phrase would naturally be used to designate the
dramatic chorus as well, and οἱ ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς σκηνῆς would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
used in the restricted sense for the actors alone, even in opposition
to the dramatic chorus. This was especially common in the
case of οἱ ἀπὸ σκηνῆς, doubtless because the scene-building was
thought of as the home of the characters “from” which they
came, as the choreutae, whether dramatic or dithyrambic, did
not. Thus, a lyrical duet between the dramatic chorus and the
actors (a <i>commus</i>—κομμός) is defined as a “dirge shared by the
χοροῦ καὶ &#60;τῶν&#62; ἀπὸ σκηνῆς.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> But neither the original meaning
of ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς σκηνῆς nor this secondary development which
brought it into opposition to the thymelic performers and even
to the dramatic choreutae presupposes a raised stage for the
exclusive use of actors, still less requires that σκηνή should have
meant “stage.”</p>

<p>Now οἱ ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς σκηνῆς and οἱ ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς θυμέλης are
exactly equivalent to the more common expressions οἱ σκηνικοί
and οἱ θυμελικοί. For example, Euripides is called both ὁ ἐπὶ
τῆς σκηνῆς φιλόσοφος and <i>philosophus scaenicus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The relationship
is an obvious one, but is worth noting because one of Bethe’s
pupils has made σκηνικός and θυμελικός the basis of an attempt to
prove the existence of a stage in the fourth-century theater at
Athens. But since the earlier expressions ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς σκηνῆς
and ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς θυμέλης were used with the same distinctions of
meaning but without presupposing a stage, there is obviously
no need of one to explain the later expressions. Moreover,
Dr. Frei is guilty of an egregious <i>petitio principii</i>: he first accepts
Bethe’s hypothesis that the Lycurgus theater had a stage and
consequently concludes that the distinction between σκηνικός
and θυμελικός must be explained on the basis of difference in the
place of performance there, and then uses these conclusions to
prove a stage at that period.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> All attempts to forge a pro-stage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
argument out of any of these expressions must be pronounced a
failure. But of course in the Roman era, after most Greek
theaters had been provided with a raised stage, the differentiation
between ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς σκηνῆς and σκηνικός, on the one hand, and
ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς θυμέλης and θυμελικός, on the other, became doubly
appropriate, because the difference in levels now reinforced a
distinction which had already existed without it.</p>

<p>Vitruvius, of course, made no philological or archaeological
study of the two adjectives but explained them in terms of the
theater which was known to him (see <a href="#Page_76">pp. 76 f.</a>, above). It should
be noted, however, that Vitruvius mentions only the tragic and
comic actors under the term <i>scaenici</i> and includes under <i>thymelici</i>
“the other artists” who perform in the orchestra. Does the
dramatic chorus belong among the latter? Or is it simply
ignored here? The answer is far from certain. If we were
dealing only with new plays, it is conceivable that the choruses
were so detached from the histrionic action as to be able to stand
ten or twelve feet below the actors. But it is well known that
some of the fifth-century tragedies were still popular and frequently
acted; and as we have already seen, they were not
amenable to any such method of staging. In revivals of early
masterpieces, then, did all the performers, actors and chorus
alike, appear in the orchestra, as in the old Greek theaters? Or
was the chorus so reduced in size, and its manner of performance
so altered, that it could stand with the actors on the high and
narrow Graeco-Roman stage, as they all certainly did on the low
and broad Roman stage? It is impossible to determine. All
that can truthfully be said is that Vitruvius does not clearly
indicate the place of the dramatic chorus in the Graeco-Roman
theater. My own opinion is that he is speaking of two distinct
types of performance and is ignoring the dramatic chorus.</p>

<p>The same question arises in connection with Pollux. He
catalogues eleven parts of a theater. Of these, only six concern
us at present: σκηνή, orchestra, logium, proscenium, parascenia,
and hyposcenium (IV, 123). Dörpfeld thinks that Pollux is
describing the Greek Hellenistic theater,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> but Pollux was for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
many years a professor at Athens and dedicated his work to the
emperor Commodus (161-92 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). Unless his language prevents
it, it is more natural to suppose that he had the Athenian
structure of his own day in mind, and this would be the Nero
theater. In that case, every term falls into place. For the
Nero theater logium could refer to the stage alone; and as there
would be no sense in Pollux mentioning two words for stage, and
since no other term for scene-building as a whole (including
logium, proscenium, and parascenia) appears in his list, σκηνή
must still mean scene-building and not stage. Pollux then
proceeds to say that “the scene-building belongs to the actors
and the orchestra to the chorus,” and a little later that “entering
at the orchestra they mount to the scene-building on ladders
(steps?).”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Believing that Pollux is describing the Hellenistic
theater, Dörpfeld interprets the first of these passages much as
Aristotle’s use of ἐπὶ (ἀπὸ) τῆς σκηνῆς has just been explained.
The second passage he considers a reference to some such
unusual incident as occurs in Aristophanes’ <i>Clouds</i>, where an
actor is bidden to climb (from the orchestra) by means of a
ladder to the housetop (i.e., to the top of the scene-building) and
destroy the roof.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> There is much merit in this explanation, and
it is not necessarily inconsistent with a belief that Pollux is in
general dealing with the contemporaneous theater; such learned
digressions occur not infrequently in his text. Nevertheless,
since stone steps leading from the orchestra to the stage of the
scene-building are a part of the Phaedrus theater at Athens, it
is not improbable that they belonged also to the Nero stage, if,
as Dörpfeld first thought, this was only about six inches higher
than the present stage (see <a href="#Page_74">p. 74</a>, above). On the other hand,
the pro-stage writers boldly cite these passages in support of
their views and as if they pertained to the earlier periods of the
theater’s history. But though Pollux is probably discussing a
theater with a stage, σκηνή does not mean stage in these two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
sentences any more than in his catalogue of theater parts; and
his testimony, however it is to be interpreted, should not be
applied to fifth- and fourth-century conditions unless confirmatory
evidence for so doing can be produced from these periods.
Now the last of these sentences from Pollux concludes a discussion
of the conventional significance of the parodi in the ancient
theater (see <a href="#Page_233">p. 233</a>, below). In my opinion, the Nero stage,
though much deeper than the Hellenistic proscenium, was
shallow enough so that the parodi still led directly into the
orchestra. In that case, when the characters entered by either
parodus, as they would when they were thought of as coming
from the market place, harbor, or country, they would have to
pass through the orchestra first and mount from there upon the
stage by means of the steps, exactly as Pollux says. Furthermore,
if actors could traverse this route it must have been
available also for the chorus. In other words, although at this
period the orchestra was the exclusive sphere of the dithyrambic
choruses and other thymelic performers and was the normal
place for the dramatic chorus, and though the actors regularly
stood upon the stage, yet both the actors and the dramatic
chorus appeared in either orchestra or stage according to the
requirements of the plays. It must be understood, however,
that this manner of staging was confined to the Nero theater
at Athens; the stage of the Graeco-Roman theaters and the
proscenium of the Hellenistic theaters were too high to make it
feasible, and in the purely Roman theaters all performers
appeared upon the stage. But why is it permissible to
accept a low stage for the Nero theater and reject it for
the fifth century? In the first place, the stage in Roman
times is attested by incontrovertible evidence, both literary
and archaeological, but for the fifth century it rests upon pure
hypothesis. In the second place, there is no reason to believe
that the Athenian chorus in Roman times was brought into
actual contact with the tragic actors or had to pass to their
place of action so frequently as in fifth-century drama (see
<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>, above).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>There is still another sentence in Pollux which needs to be
discussed. He declares that “the hyposcenium is adorned with
columns and sculptured figures turned toward the audience, and
it lies beneath (ὑπό) the logium.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> There is no doubt as to the
general position of the hyposcenium—it is the room<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> immediately
behind the orchestra and on the same level—but there is a
division of opinion as to the type of theater which had one and
as to its function. In accordance with his belief that Pollux is
describing the Hellenistic theater, Dörpfeld understands it as
the first story of the scene-building in a theater of this type.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
The columns and statuary would then refer to the proscenium
just in front of it and to the figures which were sometimes placed
in the intercolumniations thereof. In Hellenistic theaters
Dörpfeld believes the top of the proscenium to have been used by
speakers in the public assemblies and for that reason to have been
known as a logium (see <a href="#Footnote_121">p. 59, n. 1</a>, above); the hyposcenium, of
course, lay on a lower level. Pollux’ statement could not refer
to a theater with a stage because the wall beneath the front of
the stage was not decorated with columns or statuary (see <a href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>,
above), the proscenium now being raised one story and appearing
at the back of the stage. On the contrary, the pro-stage writers
maintain that Pollux refers to the space under a stage. In this
instance I agree with them as against Dörpfeld, though I would
not look upon Pollux’ statement as applying to the theaters
before his own day. Accepting Dörpfeld’s opinion that the
Hellenistic theaters had no stage, I think that the first story of
their scene-buildings had no special name and that the term
“hyposcenium” had not yet come into use; Pollux, however, is
referring to the space under the stage in the Nero theater. The
front of this was probably adorned with the same frieze as now
stands before the Phaedrus stage, and we may not dogmatically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
assert that no columns stood there as well.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The Athens theater
was inclined to be <i>sui generis</i> at all periods, and these would not
be the only particulars in which the Nero theater differed from
the Graeco-Roman type.</p>

<p>There remains for discussion a passage in Plutarch. It
concerns an episode in the career of Demetrius Poliorcetes
(337-283 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and has been thought to refer to the theater of his
day. But a study has been made of Plutarch’s practice in such
matters and it has been found that many times he deliberately
sought vividness of presentation by modernizing his accounts
and picturing his scenes amid the familiar surroundings of
contemporaneous life; in other words, the references to the
theater in connection with his anecdotes never presuppose any
other type of building than the stage-equipped buildings of his
own day, and in several instances this method resulted in patent
anachronisms. One example will suffice.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Plutarch declares
that Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver of about the ninth century
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, believed that the minds of assemblymen were distracted
by “statues and paintings or the proscenia of theaters or the
extravagantly wrought roofs of council chambers,” and so caused
the Spartans to hold their assemblies in an open space. The
author has here modernized his account in two particulars:
he speaks as if Lycurgus were familiar with a fully developed
theater building and as if it had already come to be used, elsewhere
in Greece, as a place of meeting for the popular assembly.
Of course, Lycurgus antedated the Greek drama and all but the
crudest forms of choral performances by centuries, and this fact
was as well known to Plutarch as it is to us.</p>

  Theater at Epidaurus in Argolis</p>
  <p class="captionref"><a href="#Footnote_209">See p. 104, n. 1</a></p>
</div>

<p>Now Plutarch says<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> that “Demetrius came into the city
(Athens) and ordered the entire population to be assembled into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the theater and hedged in the scene-building (σκηνήν) on every
side with troops and surrounded the stage (λογεῖον) with guards,
and himself descending (καταβάς), like the tragic actors, through
the upper parodi (διὰ τῶν ἄνω παρόδων) he ended their fears with
his very first words.” In my opinion, the word καταβάς (“descending”)
clearly shows that λογεῖον means “stage.” The
“upper parodi,” then, must be the passages opening upon the
logium from the parascenia. As Plutarch visualized the scene
and wished his readers to do so, Demetrius came out upon the
stage from one of the side entrances but did not address the
people from there, as an orator of Plutarch’s own day would have
done.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Instead, in his desire to show the Athenians his good-will
he passed on down the central steps, as Plutarch had often
seen the actors do in that theater (see <a href="#Page_99">p. 99</a>, above), and addressed
the assemblage from the orchestra. Since he could have passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
through only one side entrance, the plural (παρόδων) must be due
to a sort of zeugma, to imply that he came through one upper
parodus and one upper entrance, viz., the central steps. The
pro-stage writers who seek to apply Plutarch’s words to the
Lycurgus theater in which the incident really happened, and who
use them as an argument for a stage at that period, are forced to
ignore the word καταβάς, for they cannot allow that “tragic
actors” regularly descended from the Lycurgus proscenium into
the orchestra. If we go back of Plutarch’s words and inquire
what Demetrius actually did in the Lycurgus theater, the answer
is plain: he simply advanced from the scene-building into the
orchestra, and expressions consistent with this must have appeared
in the source from which Plutarch derived his account.
In fact, in describing a similar scene at Corinth, Plutarch retained
words which are vague enough to be applicable to either type of
theater.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> He has simply modernized one account and brought
over the other unchanged.</p>

<p>The zenith of Attic drama had passed by, entirely for tragedy
and almost so for comedy, before the remains of theaters outside
of Athens become frequent.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Nevertheless, these sometimes aid
materially in reconstructing or interpreting the Athenian theater,
and it will be necessary to dwell briefly upon a few of them.
Perhaps the earliest and most primitive is found at Thoricus
in southern Attica (Figs. <a href="#figure70">70 f.</a>). This was built in the fifth or
fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and was subsequently enlarged somewhat.
The orchestra is oblong rather than circular, being bounded at
one side by a temple, at the other side by a greenroom or storage
chamber, and at the rear by a retaining wall. There is no reason
to believe that a permanent scene-building was ever erected
behind the orchestra. It is apparent that this structure has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
several points of resemblance to the Athenian theater of the
period between <i>ca.</i> 499 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and <i>ca.</i> 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (see <a href="#Page_65">pp. 65 f.</a>, above).</p>

<p>The most symmetrical of all the Greek theaters and one of
the best preserved is that at Epidaurus (Figs. <a href="#figure46">46-52</a> and <a href="#figure72">72, 2</a>).<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
Its architect was the younger Polyclitus, and it was built toward
the close of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> If we are right in believing
that the proscenium was not used as a stage, then the Epidaurus
theater never had a stage. At any rate, it was not rebuilt and
provided with one in Roman times. In the center of the orchestra
stands a block of stone with a circular cavity, doubtless the
foundation of the thymele. There is not only space for the full
circle of the orchestra (in the narrowest sense; see <a href="#Footnote_173">p. 83, n. 2</a>)
but the bounding stones are actually continued for the full distance.
The stone proscenium, containing half-columns (<a href="#figure72">Fig. 72,
2</a>) of the Ionic order and once eleven feet seven inches or about
twelve Roman feet in height, was erected in the second or
third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and replaced a wooden proscenium. The
parascenia were rebuilt at the same time and seem originally to
have been broader and to have projected farther from the scene-building.
In either parodus stood a handsome double gateway
(Figs. <a href="#figure49">49</a> and <a href="#figure51">51 f.</a>), one door of which led into the orchestra and
the other opened upon a ramp, somewhat sharply inclined, which
debouched on the top of the proscenium. Ramps are found also
in the Sicyon theater.</p>

</div>

<p>The theater at Eretria, on the west coast of Euboea, is not
only one of the earliest but also presents several unusual features
(Figs. <a href="#figure53">53-55</a> and <a href="#figure72">72</a>).<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> It falls into three periods. The old scene-building
was erected early in the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> A later
scene-building was erected in front of the other about 300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The
white marble proscenium belongs to the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> or later.
The precinct of Dionysus at Eretria was situated on level ground,
and this fact necessitated different arrangements than were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
feasible on the usual hillside site. The highest ground in <a href="#figure55">Fig. 55</a>
shows the original level on which the first scene-building, orchestra,
and auditorium were erected (<a href="#figure54">Fig. 54</a>). This scene-building
was of the common type with projecting parascenia between
which the proscenium must have been constructed of wood.
The seats at this period apparently were wooden bleachers like the
ἴκρια of the primitive orchestra in the old market place at Athens
(see <a href="#Page_63">pp. 63 f.</a>, above); and when they proved unsatisfactory,
it seemed easier to excavate the center of the area than to throw
up a mound around it. Accordingly, earth to a depth of ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
and a half feet was removed to form a new orchestra somewhat
north of the old one. In order that the old scene-building might
not have to be taken down or lose its serviceability, the earth
just in front of it was left standing and was held in place by a
retaining wall. Over this space was built a new scene-building,
really only an episcenium. Communication between the old
level and the new was secured by means of a vaulted passageway
and stone steps. Before the retaining wall stood a wooden
proscenium, the top of which doubtless continued the floor of the
scene-buildings at the original ground level. The boundary of
the orchestra (in the narrowest sense) stopped at the semicircumference,
but there was sufficient room before the proscenium
for the complete circle. A tunnel, six and a half feet
high and three feet wide and with stone steps at either end, led
from behind the proscenium to the center of the orchestra.
Such an arrangement is probably what Pollux referred to as
“Charon’s steps”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> and was convenient when an actor was to
make an appearance from the earth or, like the ghost of Darius
in Aeschylus’ <i>Persians</i>, from some structure which might
temporarily be erected in the orchestra. Somewhat similar
passages have been found in several other theaters, including
Athens, but because of their size or other considerations seem
not to have been used by actors. The downward pitch of the
parodus, owing to the excavations, is clearly seen in <a href="#figure55">Fig. 55</a>.
The marble proscenium is thought to have been about eleven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
and a half feet high and was supported by rimmed columns
(<a href="#figure72">Fig. 72, 1<i>b</i></a>). The parascenia did not project from this but
merely continued the line of the proscenium, as in many of the
Asia Minor theaters. Traces of tracks for the wheels of an
eccyclema (see <a href="#Page_284">pp. 284 ff.</a>, below) are said to have been found in
this theater on a level with the logium,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> but the stones have now
disappeared and their purpose is not free from doubt.</p>

received payment for a scene-building and proscenium in 290 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
Panels (πίνακες) for the proscenium are mentioned in 282 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
Wood for the “logium of the scene-building” was paid for in
279 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Extensive repairs and improvements seem to have been
carried through in 274 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Stone was provided for the parascenium
in 269 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Wood was used for “panels for the logium”
in 180 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> These were probably used to close large openings in
the episcenium (see the θυρώματα at Oropus on <a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>, below).
Most of these entries refer to wooden construction and antedate
the extant remains in stone. There is no orchestra in the more
restricted sense, but a gutter extends for about two-thirds of a
circumference. If prolonged, this would just reach the front
wall of the scene-building but would have a large segment subtended
by the proscenium. The scene-building is an oblong
with three doors in front and one in the rear. It is bounded on
all four sides by a portico about nine and a third feet high. The
front of this formed the proscenium, and it is clear that what was
an ornament and certainly not a stage on the other three sides
was primarily an ornament and certainly not a stage also on the
fourth side. The oblong pillars, which were left plain on the
other three sides of the building, on this side have their front
surfaces rounded off into half-columns, and a vertical rim
expedited the insertion of panels (<a href="#figure72">Fig. 72, 3</a>). There were no
parascenia in the stone theater except as these were provided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
by the ends of the side porticos. The inscriptions, however,
would seem to indicate that the situation had previously been
different. From the front corners of the colonnade slanting
doorways extended across the parodi. In the orchestra several
bases stand in front of the proscenium, probably for the erection
of statues or votive offerings.</p>

<p>There are theaters also at Delphi (<a href="#figure26">Fig. 26</a>), Megalopolis
(Figs. <a href="#figure27">27</a> and <a href="#figure72">72, 1<i>a</i></a>), and Sicyon, but it is not possible to discuss
every theater on the Greek mainland. We must not, however,
pass by the small theater at Oropus in northern Attica (Figs.
<a href="#figure56">56 f.</a> and <a href="#figure72">72, 4</a>).<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> It stood in the precinct of Amphiaraus and
dates from the first and second centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The auditorium
is almost completely destroyed; evidently the seats were always
wooden bleachers. Five marble thrones, however, stand within
the orchestra, an unusual arrangement which recurs at Priene
(see <a href="#Page_113">p. 113</a>, below). Another peculiarity is that no orchestra, in
the narrowest sense, is marked out, either in whole or in part. But
if a circle is drawn through the seats of honor, as has been done
in <a href="#figure56">Fig. 56</a>, it falls just outside the proscenium. On the contrary, a
circle as determined by the lowest row of seats cuts into the
proscenium slightly. The parodi have been banked up so that
their outer entrances are on a level with the top of the proscenium.
The chief merit of this theater consists in the fact
that the superior preservation of its scene-building and the
presence of two inscriptions enable us to form a fairly clear
picture of how a proscenium and an episcenium looked at this
period. The front wall of the scene-building is pierced by one
door; the side walls are continued so as to frame the proscenium
but themselves turn sharply back along the parodi without forming
projecting parascenia. The proscenium consisted of Doric
half-columns and was eight and a quarter feet high. Its central
intercolumniation was intended to be filled by a door, but the
four on either side were so made as to be readily filled in with
painted panels (<a href="#figure72">Fig. 72, 4</a>). Across the architrave ran an inscription:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
“... having been agonothete, dedicated the proscenium
and the panels.” Another inscription ran along the top of the
episcenium: “... having been priest, dedicated the scene-building
and the doors.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The last item refers to five (or three)
large openings in the front wall of the episcenium. Similar
doors are found at Ephesus, and they were doubtless used in connection
with the crane (μηχανή, see <a href="#Page_67">pp. 67 f.</a>, above, and <a href="#Page_289">p. 289</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
below). All in all, Oropus contributes very materially to our
knowledge of the ancient theater.</p>

</div>

<p>Beginning with the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the only kind of Greek
theater which was newly built was what Dörpfeld calls the
Graeco-Roman type, cf. the theaters at Termessus (<a href="#figure58">Fig. 58</a>)<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
and Aspendus in Asia Minor. During this period several Hellenistic
theaters (e.g., those at Priene, Magnesia, Tralles, Pergamum
[<a href="#figure28">Fig. 28</a>], Athens [?], Syracuse, Pompeii, etc.) were remodeled
to the Graeco-Roman type. That this is a Greek and not a
Roman form of theater is proved by the fact that its orchestra,
though no longer a complete circle, yet exceeded a semicircumference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
(see <a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>, above). These theaters had a stage varying
from eight to ten feet in height and from eleven and a half to
twenty in depth. The scene-buildings were of three stories—hyposcenium,
logium, and theologium (<a href="#figure24">Fig. 24</a>). The first
presented to the spectator an undecorated wall with doors leading
into the orchestra; the second was terminated by a proscenium
with columns and statues. The proscenium was seldom
so simple as in the earlier theaters but was an ornamental façade
with projections and recesses (<a href="#figure59">Fig. 59</a>), which added materially
to the area of the stage.</p>

</div>

<p>Hellenistic theaters could be remodeled either (<i>a</i>) by building
a new (undecorated) wall in front of the old proscenium and
roofing the two over to form a stage or (<i>b</i>) by moving back the
front wall of the scene-building slightly and constructing a stage
between this and the old proscenium.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In either case, a new
(decorated) proscenium would be erected at the back of the
stage. In the latter case, the columns of the old proscenium
would either be removed and a blank surface built in their stead
or they would be walled up. As already explained (see <a href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>,
above) this was done because the floor of the stage was thought
of as representing earth or a street. At Priene (<a href="#figure64">Fig. 64</a>) the
Hellenistic columns were left standing, but this is the sole
instance of a Graeco-Roman hyposcenium having columns.</p>

<p>Method (<i>a</i>) is illustrated at Ephesus (Figs. <a href="#figure24">24</a> and <a href="#figure59">59-62</a>),<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
where the first permanent scene-building was built about 300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
(<a href="#figure60">Fig. 60</a>). The dotted lines show the position of the stone
proscenium, eight and a half feet high and nine feet ten inches
deep, which was erected in the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (<a href="#figure61">Fig. 61</a>).
There were no parascenia. The seven openings (θυρώματα) in the
episcenium furnish an interesting parallel to the five at Oropus
(see <a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>, above). In the last half of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
structure was converted into a Graeco-Roman type (Figs. <a href="#figure24">24</a>
and <a href="#figure62">62</a>). The new logium was left of the same height as the
old proscenium, but was made nearly twenty feet deep; and at
certain points this depth received a considerable accession from
the recesses of the new proscenium (<a href="#figure59">Fig. 59</a>). These changes
were made at the expense of the orchestra, which derived some
compensation from the fact that several rows of the lowest seats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
were removed; as a result the orchestra became a sort of pit
(<a href="#figure24">Fig. 24</a>). The hyposcenium was plain and was pierced by
three doors leading into the orchestra. The top story of the
proscenium in <a href="#figure59">Fig. 59</a> was not added until the third century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Method (<i>b</i>) was employed at Priene (Figs. <a href="#figure63">63 f.</a>).<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> This
theater enjoys the distinction of being the only one in which an
altar was found, and this was not situated in the center of the
orchestra, as the foundations at Athens and Epidaurus would
seem to indicate was the case there, but on its circumference.
Seats of honor were placed in the orchestra, as at Oropus (see
<a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>, above); but in Roman times new seats for dignitaries
were erected in the center of the fifth row of seats (<a href="#figure63">Fig. 63</a>). The
proscenium was of the same age as the scene-building and belongs
to the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> At the Graeco-Roman rebuilding the
columns of this proscenium were left standing, but the intercolumniations,
except the three which served as doors, were
walled up. The front wall of the Hellenistic episcenium was torn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
down and a new proscenium was built about six and a half feet
farther back (see cross-hatched wall in <a href="#figure63">Fig. 63</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The height of the Graeco-Roman stage as compared with the
low Roman stage was partly due to convenience in remodeling
when it was kept at the same figure as the earlier proscenium,
but mostly to the conditions of exhibition.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The Greeks did not,
like the Romans, sit in their orchestras. Choral and musical
competitions still were held there, as well as such Roman sports<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
as gladiatorial and animal combats. It was necessary, therefore,
that the orchestra should be accessible from the hyposcenium, and
the doors could scarcely be lower than six and a half or seven feet.
Accordingly, the stage could hardly be less than eight feet high.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>But the seats of honor in Greek theaters had always been in
the lowest tier (nearest the orchestra), and from there the view
of dramatic performances, when presented upon an eight- or
ten-foot stage, would be seriously obstructed.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Usually when
such theaters were remodeled, as at Ephesus, Assus, Pergamum,
and Delphi, enough tiers were removed so that the lowest seats
would be only about five feet below the stage level. The
orchestra thus became like a pit and was inclosed with vertical
walls (<a href="#figure24">Fig. 24</a>). At Side the space from which seats had been
removed was built over with a six-foot wall, which was especially
suitable in view of the gladiatorial and animal fights of Roman
times. Where the auditorium was not altered, as at Priene and
Magnesia, it is supposed that the lowest seats were unoccupied
at dramatic performances, but were put to use, as the best places,
at orchestral sports and contests.</p>

<p>As to the function of the dramatic chorus in the period of the
Graeco-Roman theaters, especially in Asia Minor, we have little
information. Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider the
question. Already in Hellenistic (New) Comedy the chorus
appeared only between acts (see <a href="#Page_147">p. 147</a>, below). It is possible
that by this time it had disappeared entirely or that it was so
detached that, though the comic actors stood on a stage, the
<i>entr’actes</i> could be given in the orchestra, or that its numbers
were so reduced (see <a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a>, below) that it could perform upon a
Graeco-Roman stage—in any case, the chorus in contemporaneous
comedy is negligible. The number of the tragic choreutae
had probably been reduced also (see <a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>, below). But what is
still more significant is that, if the fragments of Roman drama
are any criterion<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>, the tragic choruses had abandoned the strophic
responsions of the old Greek tragedy, and this means the abandonment
of the complicated evolutions which had carried the
chorus over the full expanse of the ancient orchestra. It was
quite feasible for a small chorus which sang astrophic odes, spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
through its coryphaeus, and danced in a restricted fashion to
appear upon a Graeco-Roman stage with the actors, to be closely
connected with the plot, and even to participate in the action.
As to the reproduction of old plays, the situation was not especially
different. Fifth-century comedies were probably never repeated
at this period. New Comedy, as we have just seen, would
present little difficulty. As to old tragedies, the choral parts
could be excised <i>ad libitum</i> or sung on the stage by a reduced
chorus without dancing (or at least without evolutions). It will
be remembered that I do not accept Dörpfeld’s opinion that the
Nero stage at Athens was of the Graeco-Roman type. Accordingly,
I believe that different physical conditions and the glory of
their traditions kept up a livelier interest in the dramatic chorus
at Athens than elsewhere and still retained the Athenian orchestra
as the normal place of activity for the dramatic choreutae
(see <a href="#Page_99">p. 99</a>, above).</p>

<p>The foregoing account shows that there are many points of
dispute with regard to the Greek theater and many points
concerning which no one can do aught but guess. In closing,
let me repeat that we are interested in the Greek theater mainly
because of the Greek drama and that the extant pieces belong
almost exclusively to the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Now for that century
the irreducible minimum, as shown by the plays themselves, is
that there can have been no place, elevated much or little, which
was reserved exclusively for the actors.</p>

<p>If a modern theatergoer could be suddenly set down in
ancient Athens, perhaps one of the first things to surprise him
would be the discovery that he could not have recourse to
his favorite recreation any day that he might choose. Of course,
this situation resulted from the fact that ancient drama was
connected with religion, was part of some god’s worship, and as
such could be presented only at the time of his festivals. This
patron deity was uniformly Dionysus (Bacchus), god of wine,
for the reason that tragedy and satyric drama were offshoots of
the Dionysiac dithyramb (see <a href="#Page_2">pp. 2-4</a> and <a href="#Page_6">6 f.</a>, above) and that
the <i>comus</i> (κῶμος), from which comedy had developed (see <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>,
above) had a meaning and function similar to those of certain
rites of Dionysus and in the course of time was brought into
connection with his worship. At Athens, Dionysus had several
festivals, but only two at which plays were performed, viz., the
City Dionysia and the Lenaea. Thanks to the labors of many
scholars and the finding of additional inscriptional evidence
our information concerning these occasions, though still far
from complete, is somewhat less scanty than it has been.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> At
the City Dionysia tragedy dated from 534 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, while comedy
was not given official recognition there until 486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Though
the Lenaea was the older festival, its dramatic features were later,
comedy being added about 442 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and tragedy about 433 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
It ought to be stated, however, that at both festivals there had
been volunteer, unofficial performances of primitive comedy
(κῶμοι) prior to the dates just given, when the state took them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
under its formal protection. The comus was introduced into
the Lenaean festival between 580 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 560 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and into the
program of the City Dionysia about 501 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (see <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>).</p>

<p>Now if our imaginary modern visitor to ancient Athens
chanced to be somewhat acquainted with the history of mediaeval
drama, he would probably surmise that the close connection
between Greek drama and religious festivals would result in the
plays being performed in temples, just as mysteries and miracle
plays were originally presented in the churches. But in this
he would be much mistaken. There is a fundamental difference
in function between a Greek temple and a Christian church.
The latter is primarily intended as a place for congregational
worship, and its size and interior arrangements are chosen
accordingly. On the other hand, the temple was pre-eminently
thought of as the earthly abode of some divinity; it was, therefore,
uniformly too small to accommodate any considerable
crowd, neither was its interior well adapted for that purpose.
In the second place, the worshipers at an ancient shrine were not
more or less rigidly restricted to a list of members with their
more intimate relatives, neighbors, and friends, as is the case
with a Protestant church today. In most cases, any free-born
citizen would feel as free to worship at any particular
temple or to take part in its festivals as could any other citizen,
and on no infrequent occasions practically the whole body of
citizens was present. In fact, so important was it deemed that
everyone should attend the dramatic festivals that toward the
end of the fifth century it was provided that whoever felt unable
to pay the daily admission fee of two obols<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> should, upon application,
receive a grant for this purpose from the state. “The whole
city kept holiday, and gave itself up to pleasure, and to the
worship of the wine-god. Business was abandoned; the law-courts
were closed; distraints for debt were forbidden during the
continuance of the festival; even prisoners were released from
jail, to enable them to share in the common festivities.”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and slaves were admitted, if their fathers or their masters were
willing to pay their way. It seems, though the evidence is
inconclusive,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> that despite the oriental-like seclusion of Greek
households even women and girls might attend. They certainly
participated in the ceremonies of the first day. Plato and
Aristotle favored restricting the attendance, but their views
seem to have had no effect. Thus, children and respectable
women who would have invited divorce by being present at real
scenes of that character were allowed to witness the indecencies
of satyric drama and Old Comedy and to listen to the broadest
of jokes. Such is the power of religious conservatism.</p>

</div>

<p>From these considerations it follows that the attendance
upon the dramatic performances was enormous, and that the use
of temples to accommodate the spectators was entirely out of
the question. Therefore it became necessary to provide a
separate structure, which in fourth-century Athens could seat
as many as seventeen thousand. From this fact arose the
further necessity for an annual procession, in order to escort the
statue of Dionysus from his temple to his theater. Since the two
buildings were situated in the same precinct on the south slope
of the Acropolis and within a few feet of each other (Figs. <a href="#figure29">29</a>
and <a href="#figure32">32</a>), there was no need of the processional ceremony being
other than a very simple one. As a matter of fact, from the
spectacular standpoint this was one of the most splendid features
of the festival and consumed the whole first day. It has been
claimed that several Attic vases, dating from the close of the
sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and depicting the “wagon-ship” of Dionysus,
give a hint as to the character of this part of the City
Dionysia (<a href="#figure65">Fig. 65</a>).<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The car is drawn by two men representing
attendant sprites of Dionysus. The tip of the long equine tail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
of one of them is clearly indicated. In the car are two other
sprites, whether sileni or satyrs, playing on flutes, and the god
himself is seated between them. Alongside of the sacrificial bull
are two citizens standing. Farther forward are two youths with
branches (θαλλοφόροι), then a youth with a censer, another with
a basket (κανηφόρος), and finally, at the head of the procession,
a boy who is perhaps to be regarded as a trumpeter. Whatever
relationship may subsist between such vase paintings and contemporaneous
drama (see <a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>, above) the entire free population,
from the chief magistrate of the city (the archon eponymus)
down, participated in the procession at the City Dionysia and took
the god’s statue by stages from his temple to a point near the
Academy on the road to Eleutherae (<a href="#figure02">Fig. 2</a>). This direction was
chosen because, as the Athenian god’s cognomen of Eleuthereus
shows, this image and its cult were supposed to have been
introduced from this town on Attica’s northern border (see <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>
and <a href="#Footnote_52">n. 3</a>, above) and because the return of the processional was
intended to imitate the final portion of the original entry.
After the remainder of the day had been spent in rites and
festivities the procession escorted the sacred relic back to its
precinct by torchlight and placed it near the orchestra in the
theater, where it remained during the rest of the festival. Thus
the god was supposed to have witnessed every play presented at
the City Dionysia from 534 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> on, and it is as a connoisseur and
critic of wide experience that he is appointed to judge between
the rival claims of Aeschylus and Euripides in Aristophanes’
<i>Frogs</i>, vss. 810 f. Our English and Protestant ideas concerning
the nature of a religious ceremony are only too likely to give us a
misleading conception of the whole festival and especially of its
first day. The <i>festa</i> of some popular saint in Southern Europe,
who demands the veneration of his people and yet is broad-minded
enough to enter into the spirit of the occasion and is not
offended even by being made the subject of rollicking jests,
would afford a far better parallel, and even this falls short.
Drunkenness combined with the darkness at the close of the
day’s proceedings to intensify the license natural on such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
occasion. Children born as the result of chance meetings at
these annually recurring processions are frequently mentioned
in New Comedy and often motivate the action.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the religious character of these festivals and of
the dramatic exhibitions connected with them was a very real
thing to the Greeks, and everyone in attendance would fully
realize that he was present at no secular proceeding. To a
mediaeval spectator of miracle plays and mysteries this feeling
would seem perfectly natural, but it would be another occasion
of surprise to a modern visitor. Already in Elizabethan times
Shakespeare could assure his audience: “Our true intent is all
for your delight.” So exclusively is this now the motive of
theatrical performances that we seldom think of the theater as a
place for the inculcation of religious truths or for teaching the
facts of religious history. It follows that the subject-matter of
Greek drama was drawn from their mythology as inevitably and
uniformly as the text of a modern sermon is drawn from the
Bible. In fact, freedom of choice was originally still more
restricted. Whether tragedy was derived from satyric drama
and satyric drama from the dithyramb or whether, as I believe,
both tragedy and satyric drama were independent offshoots of
the dithyramb (see <a href="#Page_2">pp. 2-4</a>), this remains true—the early dithyramb
was exclusively devoted to the exaltation of Dionysus, and
in consequence the themes of tragedy and of satyric drama were
likewise, at the beginning, entirely Dionysiac. By the time
of Thespis or soon thereafter (see <a href="#Page_20">pp. 20 f.</a>, above) tragedy
broadened out so as to treat any mythological theme. Of the
thirty-two extant Greek tragedies Dionysus appears in only one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Euripides’ <i>Bacchanals</i>, and even in that he is disguised during
most of the play. But the playwrights were not content to stop
at this point. Phrynichus, who was a pupil of Thespis and won
his first victory in 511 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, introduced the innovation of dramatizing
contemporaneous history. In 494 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the Persians captured
and destroyed the Ionic city of Miletus. Shortly thereafter
Phrynichus treated this subject in a tragedy. Though it moved
the Athenians to tears, they were so indignant at being reminded
of the misfortunes of their kinsmen that they fined the poet one
thousand drachmae. Undeterred by this rebuff, however, in
476 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Phrynichus brought out his <i>Phoenician Women</i>,
dealing with the Persian invasion of Greece in 480-479 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
This play served as a model for Aeschylus’ <i>Persians</i> (472 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
on the same subject. But by laying the scenes of these plays
in Asia Minor or Persia the dramatists gained remoteness of
place instead of the usual remoteness of time. As Racine<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> wrote
on a similar occasion: “The general public makes hardly any
distinction between that which is removed from them by a
thousand years or by a thousand leagues.” A still further
innovation was made toward the close of the fifth century by
Agathon, in whose <i>Antheus</i> both incidents and character names
were entirely fictitious. A very similar development can be
traced in mediaeval times. Originally the gospel story was the
theme, then subordinate incidents of Scripture, then the lives
of saints since Bible times, then allegorical tales, etc.</p>

<p>But in practice Greek tragedians did not avail themselves
of their liberty. Agathon’s innovation was not followed up;
and though the Greeks did not sharply differentiate mythology
and history,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> they did not take kindly to the treatment of contemporary
events in tragedy. The three plays above mentioned
exhaust the instances at Athens. Even in mythological subjects
experimentation soon led them to confine themselves to the
stories of a few houses—to the misfortunes of Oedipus, Orestes,
Meleager, Thyestes, etc. This tendency is illustrated by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
fact that three of the extant tragedies, Aeschylus’ <i>Libation-Bearers</i>,
Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i>, and Euripides’ play of the same name,
ring the changes upon the same topic. Since almost every
playwright of consequence would turn his hand to these oft-tried
themes, the only chance of success necessarily lay in improving
upon the dramatic technique and the elaboration of character
and plot already displayed by one’s rivals. As Aristotle wrote,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
each poet was expected “to surpass that which was the strong
point of each of his predecessors.” We are therefore not surprised
to learn from the same source that in his day the finest
tragedies were based upon these hackneyed subjects. Furthermore,
the practice is commended by so high a modern authority
as Goethe: “If I were to begin my artistic life over again, I
should never deal with a new story. I should always invest the
old stories with new and more vital meanings.”</p>

<p>The poets’ choice of tragic themes from traditional mythology
does not mean that their material was rigid and intractable.
They enjoyed entire freedom to revamp the old tales, by invention,
alteration, or suppression, in order to suit their own purposes.
Here again the practice of the mediaeval playwrights,
though more restricted to minor matters, affords the best clue.
On the other hand, the fact that most spectators knew at least
the general outline of his plot in advance allowed the ancient
dramatist to introduce numerous subtleties that are quite beyond
the reach of modern playwrights (see <a href="#Page_315">pp. 315 f.</a>, below). It is
true, as Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> warns us, that “even the known stories were
known only to a few.” Nevertheless, the more intelligent in the
audience would always be well informed, and of the oft-repeated
tragic themes even the most stupid could hardly remain in
ignorance.</p>

<p>In the case of satyric drama the situation was naturally
somewhat different. Whatever the relationship between the
dithyramb, satyr-play, and tragedy, the fact remains that the
satyr-play was placed in the program of the City Dionysia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
largely as a concession to the Dionysiac element. Consequently,
Bacchic themes were retained in the satyric drama long after
they had been abandoned by tragedy. Even so, it did not take
long to develop a secondary stage in which the Dionysiac
element is practically restricted to the appearance of Bacchus’
attendant sprites, the chorus of satyrs, who are harshly superimposed
upon some non-Dionysiac subject. Until recently our
direct information concerning the satyr-play was derived solely
from Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i>, the only extant representative of this
genre, but now the major portion of another, <i>The Trackers
(Ichneutae)</i> by Sophocles, has been revealed to us.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Both in the
<i>Cyclops</i> and now in the <i>Trackers</i> the Bacchic element is restricted
to Silenus and the chorus of satyrs, and Dionysus himself figures
only as he is appealed to or mentioned in the choral odes or
episodes. How generally Bacchus was omitted from his own
special brand of play we have no means of knowing, but it was
inevitable that this should not be a rare occurrence. The myths
in which the wine-god could appropriately appear in person must
soon have been exhausted; and the playwrights, more concerned
in producing an interesting performance than in maintaining an
outworn custom, would yearn to exercise in this field the same
freedom that they had already won for themselves in the composition
of tragedies. Even in the two plays now before us the
new wine is fairly bursting the seams of the old wineskins. In
the <i>Cyclops</i>, Silenus and his children are joined to the story of
Odysseus’ adventures in Polyphemus’ cave, in which neither
earlier mythology nor rhyme or adequate reason had vouchsafed
them a place. Their presence is explained by the statement that
they had set sail in search of Dionysus, after learning that he had
been seized by pirates, were shipwrecked near Mt. Aetna, and
enslaved by the Cyclops (vss. 11 ff.). The situation in the
<i>Trackers</i> is still more forced. The play deals with the theft of
Apollo’s cattle by the infant Hermes. Upon the offer of a
reward, the satyrs turn detectives in order to track down the
stolen beasts. Thus it will be seen that in both plays the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
Dionysiac element is a mechanical, extraneous feature in the plot.
It is not surprising that the dramatic poets should chafe under the
limitations of so clumsy a compromise.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Yet again, in the case of comedy the situation was still
different. The embryonic form of comedy, the comus, was
originally intended by a sort of sympathetic magic to superinduce
friendly powers and to expel malign spirits, and involved neither
plot, unity of theme, nor fiction. When these features were
introduced, they were influenced by mature tragedy and by
the Sicilian mime, which had already reached a high stage of development
(see <a href="#Page_36">pp. 36 f.</a> and <a href="#Page_46">46-52</a>, above). As a result, though
comedy had become as much a part of Dionysiac worship as was
tragedy or satyric drama, it did not go through a stage of
Bacchic or semi-Bacchic themes, but passed at once to fictitious
subjects. The difference between tragedy and comedy in this
regard is clearly indicated by Antiphanes, a poet of Middle
Comedy:<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Tragedy is a happy creation in every respect, since the audience knows
the plot before ever a word has been spoken. The tragic poet needs only
to awaken their memories. If I barely mention Oedipus, they know all the
rest: that his father is Laius, his mother Jocaste, who are his sons and
daughters, what he has done, and what will befall him.... This is not
possible for us, but we must invent everything: new names, preceding
events, the present circumstances, the catastrophe, and the exposition.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Furthermore, the Sicilian mime seems to have been unassociated
with religious worship, and perhaps this fact has a share in
explaining the irreverent, almost atheistic, tendency which Attic
comedy manifested. Though it was part of divine worship, it
treated the divinities with the utmost disrespect. Even Dionysus
himself, the patron deity of the festivals, is represented in
Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i> as cowardly, lecherous, and foolish, beaten
with many stripes before the eyes of his worshipers.</p>

<p>The Greek theater suffered no scene of bloodshed to be
enacted before its audience. When the plot of the play, as was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
not infrequently the case, required such an incident, the harrowing
details were narrated by a messenger who had witnessed the
event. In Aeschylus’ <i>Persians</i> the combats between Greeks and
Asiatics are all narrated. In Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i>
and Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i> the fatal duel between the
brothers occurs off-stage. Similarly, in Euripides’ <i>Bacchanals</i>
the report is brought to Thebes that Pentheus has been torn to
pieces on Mt. Cithaeron. In these and numerous other cases
the incidents related took place at some distance from the
imaginary scene. When it is remembered that the action of
Greek plays is usually laid before a palace or temple, it will at
once occur to everyone how conveniently located such a structure
was for violence nearer the scene of action. Thus, in Aeschylus’
<i>Libation-Bearers</i> (vs. 904) Orestes drives his mother indoors
to dispatch her, and in Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i> he is lucky enough to
enter the palace and find her there alone and off her guard.
This situation recurred again and again, and a further refinement
lay close at hand. The hearts of the spectators were often
thrilled with tragic fear or pity by hearing from behind the
scenes the screams of the dying, their cries for help, even their
death rattle. So Agamemnon dies in Aeschylus’ play of that
name (vss. 1343-45); so Clytemnestra in Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i>
(vss. 1404 ff.) and Euripides’ play of the same title (vss. 1165-67);
so Lycus in Euripides’ <i>Madness of Heracles</i> (vss. 749 and 754);
and so many another. The murder of Duncan in <i>Macbeth</i>
shows that such scenes must have been far more effective than
any attempt at a realistic representation could possibly have
been. An additional effect is sometimes secured by flinging
open the back scene and disclosing the dead forms within; cf.
the slaughtered children of Heracles (Euripides’ <i>Madness of
Heracles</i>, vss. 1029 ff.), Eurydice (Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i>, vs. 1293),
etc. Sometimes death-cries and the opened scene are combined,
as in Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i>, vss. 1343-45, 1372 ff. Still
another artifice for avoiding seen violence is found in Euripides’
<i>Children of Heracles</i>, which ends by Alcmene and her attendants
dragging Eurystheus off to his doom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>The rule of Greek dramaturgy which has just been described
is liable to one notable exception—the dramatic characters may
not commit murder before the eyes of the spectators but they
may commit suicide there. Not, of course, that all suicides
must take place within the audience’s vision; most of them, like
all cases of manslaughter, are reported. But the important fact
remains that at least in some instances suicide is enacted before
the spectators’ very eyes. So, in Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i> that hero falls
upon his sword (vs. 865), and in Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i> (vs. 1071)
Evadne flings herself from the rocks upon her husband’s funeral
pyre. It thus appears that it is neither the bare fact of death
nor yet its mere hideousness which was obnoxious to ancient
taste. The first conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the life-strength
of Alcestis is allowed to ebb away upon the stage
(Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i>, vs. 391), and the second by the sight of
Heracles racked by agonizing tortures in Sophocles’ <i>Maidens
of Trachis</i>, vss. 983 ff. The distinction between what is
permissible and what is forbidden seems to hinge upon a
trivial matter, viz., whether only one character is involved or
several.</p>

<p>Passing now to the <i>raison d’être</i> of this practice I will first
mention some minor considerations. The paucity of actors in
Greek drama (see <a href="#Page_182">p. 182</a>, below) made any representation of mass
effects, such as a battle, quite impossible. The lack of complicated
stage machinery prevented the melodramatic actualism
that modern audiences love so well. Being thus unaccustomed
to the more difficult feats of realism, the ancients had not learned
to demand it in lesser matters. Without a sigh they dispensed
with that which everyone knew to be incapable of actual enactment
before their eyes. Furthermore, in the absence of a drop
curtain (see <a href="#Page_243">pp. 243 f.</a>, below) it would have been necessary for
characters slain upon the stage either to rise and walk casually
off, as in the Chinese theaters of today, or to be carried off. The
first alternative is unthinkable in ancient Greece and the second
would have been too monotonous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>It has also been claimed<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> that the use of masks, each with its
own unchanging features, would have been an insuperable
obstacle to scenes of violence, as normally presupposing great
and rapid changes in the facial expressions of the characters.
But in connection with other scenes the Greeks frequently ignored
and frequently evaded the difficulties caused by the immobility
of their masks (see <a href="#Page_222">pp. 222 f.</a>, below); so there is no reason to
believe that the use of masks would by itself have driven incidents
of this nature from the Greek stage.</p>

<p>Ludovico Castelvetro (1570) alleged that the high and narrow
stage of the Greek theater was too cramped for the dignified
representation of violence. Whatever plausibility this suggestion
may previously have enjoyed has been lost since Dörpfeld
has shown that the fifth-century theater at Athens had no raised
platform for the exclusive use of actors and that actors and
chorus stood alike in the broad expanse of the orchestra (see
<a href="#Page_79">pp. 79</a> and <a href="#Page_117">117</a>, above) (Figs. <a href="#figure22">22 f.</a>).</p>

<p>It is customary to explain the Greek avoidance of violence
upon aesthetic grounds; to assert that the susceptibilities of the
Greeks were so refined as to have been offended by scenes of
bloodshed. That which would be disagreeable or painful to see
in real life should never be presented to an audience. This is the
French position. In the first place the French took over the
Greek practice on faith. It was only when they were called upon
to explain it that they proceeded to evolve this justification.
Then the logic of their argument carried them beyond their
models. “A character in &#60;French&#62; tragedy could be permitted
to kill himself, whether he did it by poison or steel:
what he was not suffered to do was to kill someone else. And
while nothing was to be shown on the stage which could offend
the feelings through the medium of the eyes, <i>equally was nothing
to be narrated with the accompaniment of any adjuncts that could
possibly arouse disagreeable sensations in the mind</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> They were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
therefore under the necessity of attempting to paint the lily—“they
took exception to the way in which Philoctetes speaks of
the plasters and rags which he applied to his sores; and equally
so to the description which Tiresias gives in the <i>Antigone</i> of the
filth of the ill-omened birds which had fed on the carcass of
Polynices.”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> I would not be understood as altogether rejecting
this aesthetic explanation; doubtless the practice of the Greek
playwrights created, if it did not find ready made, such taste
concerning these matters. It certainly applies to cases of
blinding, which, whether self-imposed (Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus the
King</i>) or wrought by others (Euripides’ <i>Hecabe</i>), always take
place off-scene—the later sight of the bloody masks and ghastly
eyes is harrowing enough and to spare. Nevertheless, however
strong a case may be made out for it, the aesthetic interpretation
cannot, because of one cogent objection, provide the real,
ultimate reason for the convention. Is suicide so much less
revolting than homicide that the same taste can consistently
shrink from the sight of one but tolerate the other?</p>

<p>The same objection lies against another suggestion, viz.,
that the theater precinct was sacred ground which would be
polluted by murder, though done in mimicry. To those who
remember the taint which the Greeks thought to be brought upon
a land by manslaughter, this theory will not, at first, seem lacking
in plausibility. But unfortunately, accidental homicide and
suicide were thought to involve pollution no less than did murder.
Even a natural death, in the Greeks’ opinion, brought a taint.
Consequently, this suggestion fails to explain how suicides and
natural deaths could occur on the Greek stage.</p>

<p>My own interpretation of the phenomena under consideration
is somewhat similar to that just mentioned. Not only was the
theater sacred ground but all who were connected with the
dramatic performances—those who bore the expenses (the
choregi; see <a href="#Page_270">p. 270</a>, below), poets, actors, and chorus—“were
looked upon as ministers of religion, and their persons were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
sacred and inviolable.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Even the audience shared in this
immunity. Any outrage at such a time and in such a place was
not viewed in its usual light but was visited with severe penalties
as an act of desecration. Thus, when Demosthenes acted as
choregus for a dithyrambic chorus in 350 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and was assaulted
by Midias, he wished the latter to be punished, not merely for
assault (ὕβρις) but for sacrilege (ἀσέβεια).<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> In the speech which
he prepared for this suit Demosthenes cited some of the precedents
(§§ 178-80). He reminded his auditors how Ctesicles had
been put to death for striking a personal enemy with a whip
during the procession and how in 363 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the archon’s own father
had only by a natural death avoided punishment for having
violently ejected a spectator from a seat which he had unwarrantably
occupied. In like manner the person of an actor was for
the time being sacrosanct. Of course, the Greeks were not fools;
they knew that a single blow in genuine anger was a greater
outrage than murder itself in make-believe. Convention allowed
the audience to express their disapproval of actors or of their
performances by pelting them with figs, olives, or even stones.
Custom had dulled their sanctity to this extent. Nevertheless,
the taboo which had been derived from ancient ritual prevented
one actor from murdering another upon the stage. But this
taboo did not protect an actor against himself or against the
assaults of nature or of the gods. Hence suicides and natural
deaths were permissible within the audience’s sight, though
homicides were not.</p>

<p>In comedy the influences which tended to prevent the enacting
of scenes of violence were partly nullified by the fact that one
of the purposes of the comus and other fertility rites had been
the expulsion of malign powers by violence, not only of language
but also of conduct (see <a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>, above). Of course the comic
playwrights rarely had occasion to treat of death or murder.
But scenes of physical violence and horseplay, such as the lashes
administered to Xanthias and Dionysus (at his own festival!) in
Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i>, vss. 644 ff., are common.</p>

</div>

<p>Tragedy and satyric drama were derived from the dithyramb;
comedy from the comus (see <a href="#Page_6">pp. 6</a>, <a href="#Page_23">23 f.</a>, <a href="#Page_36">36</a>, and <a href="#Page_43">43 f.</a>, above).
Now both the dithyramb and the comus were entirely choral.
Consequently early tragedy and comedy were also choral. No
other fact in the history of Greek drama is better authenticated,
both by literary tradition and the extant plays, than this.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The
dithyrambic chorus consisted of fifty dancers, and this seems to
have been the size of the chorus also in early tragedy. So the
chorus in Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i> (between 500 and 490 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
was made up of the fifty daughters of Danaus. Whether this
was still the regular practice or a reversion, on this occasion, to
the earlier number cannot now be determined. At least by
487 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the tragic chorus had been reduced to twelve. It is
supposed that this came about as follows: During the fifth
century each tragic poet was required to present four plays at a
time in the annual competition at the City Dionysia, three
tragedies and one satyric drama. This grouping of plays cannot
be proven for any poet before Aeschylus (525-456 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and
probably was introduced at a rearrangement of the festival
program which took place about 501 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The members of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
chorus (the choreutae) must have found it irksome to memorize
the words, music, dance steps, and stage business for so many
plays. To relieve this burden Aeschylus or a contemporary
divided the choreutae at his disposal into four groups of twelve
each, assigning one group as a chorus for each of his four plays.
Whether the dramatist continued to be provided with forty-eight
or fifty choreutae or whether, as the rôle of the chorus lost
its bulk and importance, a single group of twelve choreutae
appeared in all four pieces is unknown. In the former case, the
three groups of choreutae that would normally be idle during any
one play could be conveniently employed as a supplementary
chorus, mute attendants, etc. But however this may be, twelve
was the size of the chorus in the three extant tragedies of Aeschylus
which followed the <i>Suppliants</i>; and it continued to be such
until the middle of the fifth century, when Sophocles raised the
number to fifteen.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> This innovation enabled the chorus to enter
the orchestra in three files of five men each and to retain this
formation for their dance movements. This gave better results
than to draw them up, as was previously necessary, in two files
of six men each or three files of four each. Furthermore, the
chorus leader (the <i>coryphaeus</i>) could now stand to one side
occasionally without spoiling the symmetry of the two half-choruses,
each of which had a sub-leader of its own. Aeschylus
probably adopted Sophocles’ innovation in the three plays which
he brought out in 458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> One of the test passages is <i>Agamemnon</i>,
vss. 1344-71, where a single tetrameter line seems to be
assigned to each of three choreutae and an iambic couplet to each
of the remaining twelve. There is no reason to believe that the
number was altered again for a long time; but further information
of a change is lacking until Roman times—at Cyrene a wall-painting
of a tragic chorus represents but seven choreutae.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that the chorus in the early comus consisted of
any fixed number. Toward the end of the fifth century the
comic chorus contained twenty-four choreutae. Probably this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
number was chosen at the time that comedy was granted the
official recognition of the state, 486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> If such was the case
the comic chorus was just twice as large as the tragic chorus
of that period. The reason for doubling the number is found in
the hostility which frequently rent the chorus of ancient comedy
and in the parallelism which is an outstanding feature of its
choral odes (cf. <a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>, above). About the close of the fourth
century, when the functions of the comic chorus had been greatly
curtailed, it is likely that its size was also reduced. At any rate,
the chorus at the Soteric festival at Delphi from 272 to 269 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
contained but seven or eight choreutae and at Delos in the next
century only four.</p>

<p>The chorus of Greek comedy was Protean in the forms that
it assumed. In accordance with the animal disguises which were
so popular in the early comus (see <a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>, above), we hear of
choruses representing wasps, birds, frogs, goats, snakes, bees, gall-insects,
fishes, ants, storks, etc. A suggestion as to the appearance
of such choruses is afforded by five Attic vase paintings of
about 500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (Figs. <a href="#figure12">12-16</a>). Still more fantastic were choruses
of clouds, dreams, cities, seasons, islands, laws, ships, sirens,
centaurs, sphinxes, dramas, etc. Less grotesque would be
choruses of Persians, knights, graces, athletes, poets, etc. These
lists convey but a slight hint of the diversity which the fancy of
the poets provided for the choruses of Old and Middle Comedy.
The choreutae, of course, were always men, but some or all of
them might be dressed to represent women. Thus, the clouds
in Aristophanes’ play are thought of as women, and in his <i>Frogs</i>
the chorus of initiates comprises both men and women. At the
beginning of Aristophanes’ <i>Women in Council</i> the choreutae are
men dressed to represent women who have tried to disguise
themselves as men! By the time of New Comedy the chorus had
sunk to a position of comparative insignificance and had become
more conventional, usually consisting of men engaged in a
carousal (κῶμος). In the earliest form of Attic tragedy the
chorus was invariably composed of sileni.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> But when its themes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
were no longer exclusively Dionysiac (see <a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>, above), the
choruses became more sedate, generally consisting simply of
men or women. In most cases these are citizens of the imagined
scene of action. In addition to sex it was customary to indicate
whether they were thought of as being young or old. Sometimes
they are characterized as foreigners. For example, the scene
of Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i> is laid in Thebes; but dress,
accent, and the habit of oriental prostration mark the women
in the chorus as non-Hellenic. The staid character of tragic
choruses is abandoned in the unique furies of Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i>.
According to tradition their black garments, bloody faces,
and snaky locks produced so frightful an impression that boys
fainted and women miscarried. In satyric drama the chorus
always consisted of satyrs (see <a href="#Page_125">pp. 125 f.</a>, above).</p>

<p>One of the first problems that confronted the Greek dramatist
was the choice of such a character for his chorus as would make
it an integral part of the play’s action. The never-changing
character of the chorus in the satyr-plays prevented, for the most
part, anything but the loosest of connections between chorus
and actors there, as we have already noted (<a href="#Page_126">pp. 126 f.</a>, above).
In tragedy the task was somewhat easier, yet still most difficult.
In the earliest Greek tragedy extant, Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i>,
the chorus, the fifty daughters of Danaus who have fled from
Egypt to Argos in order to escape marriage with their fifty
cousins, are themselves the story. The actors are of secondary
importance. From the standpoint of dramatic interest Danaus
himself, the king of Argos, and the suitors’ herald do not compare
with the girls themselves. In the <i>Persians</i> and the <i>Seven against
Thebes</i>, Aeschylus has been nearly as successful. In these plays
the fate of the chorus, though not the prime object of interest, is
almost inextricably bound up with that of the other dramatic
characters. In the former the Persian elders, for patriotic as
well as personal motives, are no less concerned than the queen
mother (Atossa) or King Xerxes himself in the fate of the army
invading Greece. Similarly, in the <i>Seven against Thebes</i> the
possibility of the city’s being captured has as vital a meaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
to the chorus of Theban girls as to the others, and frightens them
more. Here we find a new note; for whereas in the first part
of the play the thought of the danger threatening themselves and
the city swallows up all else, in the last part their hearts are torn
with fear for Eteocles as he fares forth to single combat with his
brother. This latter motivation, viz., that the chorus should
be moved by a more or less sentimental interest in some actor
rather than by a vital fear for itself, or for others and itself, was
destined to play a prominent part in the history of the dramatic
chorus. It recurs in Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, <i>Agamemnon</i>,
and <i>Libation-Bearers</i> (not to mention the plays of Sophocles and
Euripides), in all of which the interest of the chorus in the
action is more or less adventitious. Even in such cases, however,
it was the practice of Greek playwrights, if possible, to
bind the chorus more intimately to the hero in the final catastrophe.
Thus, in <i>Prometheus Bound</i> the daughters of Oceanus,
who constitute the chorus, bear no real relationship to the leading
character; nevertheless, at the close (vs. 1067) they declare their
wish to share his fate, mount the crag where he is fastened, and
with him are hurled to Tartarus. A final refinement is found in
Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i>. Here the chorus of furies, so far from
fearing for or sympathizing with one of the characters, is set in
deadly opposition to Orestes and is bent upon tracking the
guilty man down. Inasmuch as this was the especial duty of
furies the chorus is raised once more to a point of primary importance.
Thus it appears that from the standpoint of choral
technique Aeschylus’ earliest play, the <i>Suppliants</i>, and his last
play, the <i>Eumenides</i>, are the most successful.</p>

<p>In general, the chorus in Sophocles and Euripides is less
intimately related to the plot than in Aeschylus. Yet there are
notable exceptions to this statement. Thus, the chorus of
Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i> consists of Argive women together with
their handmaids—the mothers of the seven chieftains who fell
in the attack upon Thebes. They implore the aid of Theseus
to force the Thebans to surrender the bodies of their sons for
burial. According to ancient thought this was a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
paramount importance and the whole play is occupied with it.
The mothers are in fact the chief personages of the drama; the
other characters speak and act only in their behalf. Not even
the Danaids of Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i> are more indispensable to
the mechanism of the piece. On the other hand, the connection
between chorus and plot in Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i> is of
the flimsiest. This tragedy deals with the same subject as
Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i>. But the Aeschylean chorus
consists, as we have observed, of Theban girls who are vitally
concerned in the outcome of the battle. Euripides’ chorus is
made up of Tyrian virgins on their way to Delphi. They have
no personal interest in the possible capture of Thebes or in the
fratricidal strife of Eteocles and Polynices.</p>

<p>The same sort of thing occurs also in Old Comedy. Dr. Fries
(<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 35) correctly points out that the knights in Aristophanes’
play of that name are present rather to listen than to
act. In Aristophanes’ <i>Clouds</i> and <i>Frogs</i> the connection between
chorus and action is of the slightest and entirely artificial. In
general it can be said that the character of comic choruses is
chosen rather to fit into some fantastic situation, and may be
largely ignored toward the end of the play. Thus, in Aristophanes’
<i>Women at the Thesmophoria</i> the women of Athens assemble
to contrive a punishment for Euripides, who has been maligning
their sex. Euripides’ father-in-law, made up as a woman, tries
to defend him but is detected. During vss. 871-1160 Euripides
under various disguises attempts to rescue his relative, but each
time is frustrated. But the chorus of Euripides-haters assist
in balking him neither by word nor deed. Their original character,
if retained throughout these lines, would have too effectually
thwarted the humor of his stratagems.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to detect more subtle effects in the
relations between chorus and actors. Since the chorus is usually
friendly to the principal character, the bond of sympathy is
often strengthened by having the chorus of the same sex and
of about the same age as that character. So, in Aeschylus’
<i>Libation-Bearers</i> the choreutae are Trojan slave women who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
cognizant of conditions in the palace and fully share Electra’s
eagerness to avenge her father’s murder. In Sophocles’ <i>Maidens
of Trachis</i> the chorus of girls is in thorough accord with the gentle,
unsophisticated Deianira. Furthermore, men or older women
might have warned her against sending to her husband a robe
dipped in the centaur’s blood, an act which is so essential to the
plot; but such innocence is made to seem entirely plausible by
reason of the youth and inexperience of the chorus. On the
contrary, sometimes the run of the plot requires an effect
precisely the opposite. In Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i>, for example, the
isolation of the heroine is intensified by a chorus, not only of
men but of old men, who would be least sympathetic with her
violation of a public edict. In Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus Bound</i> the
defiant Titan would have scorned the overtures of a group of men,
whoever they might be, but the feminine tact and sympathy of
the Oceanides reach his heart at once. Such a chorus, moreover,
is an effective foil the better to emphasize the hero’s indomitable
strength and will-power. In Aeschylus’ <i>Persians</i> the chorus of
Persian elders is not only natural in itself, but such experienced
men’s fear for the army and their grief at its misfortunes produce
an impression of utter collapse beyond the power of any chorus
of women to effect. In Aristophanes’ <i>Knights</i> the chorus, in
spite of criticisms, was appropriately constituted, since it represented
a body of men who are said to have entertained a special
grudge against Cleon. It would be easy to extend this topic
to a great length. Suffice it to state that both the extant plays
and the ancient commentaries upon them<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> prove that the Greek
poets expended no little thought upon this detail of their
dramaturgy.</p>

<p>Having once selected his chorus, the necessity rested upon
the poet of composing choral odes appropriate to the character
chosen. In this they were not always successful. In Euripides’
<i>Electra</i> the chorus consists of virgins from the Argive countryside.
At vss. 434-78 they give an elaborate description of Achilles’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
armor. Such women would have had no opportunity of seeing
Achilles at Troy themselves, and hearsay would scarcely have
been so circumstantial. Again, in Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i>,
vss. 638-75, 801-27, and 1019-67, the Tyrian girls unroll the
scroll of Theban history like antiquarians. Their knowledge
is not justified by the fact that Thebes had been founded, some
five generations before, by a Phoenician prince. Again, in
Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i>, vss. 1102-19, women of Troezen, the
intimates of a local washerwoman (!), discourse upon the conflict
between faith and reality! Still again, in Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia at
Aulis</i>, vss. 794-800, a band of unassuming women from Chalcis
throw doubt upon the mythological tradition that Zeus had
appeared unto Leda in the form of a swan. The first two
examples are somewhat different from the last two. The former
arise simply from failure to find a satisfactory solution for the
problem under consideration. But the latter reveal the poet
dropping his mask and using the chorus as a mouthpiece for his
own philosophizing and skepticism.</p>

<p>Lest anyone suppose that I exaggerate the difficulty or
attribute to Greek playwrights a perplexity which they did not
experience, let me point out the confessed failure of a modern
poet. Concerning the close of Act III in the second part of
<i>Faust</i>, Goethe said: “You have observed the character of the
chorus is quite destroyed by the mourning song: until this time
it has remained thoroughly antique, or has never belied its girlish
nature; but here of a sudden it becomes nobly reflecting, and
says things such as it has never thought or could think.” And
to this Eckermann, uncontradicted, replied: “These little
inconsistencies are of no consequence, if by their means a higher
degree of beauty is obtained. The song had to be sung, somehow
or other; and as there was no other chorus present, the girls
were forced to sing it.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> That Euripides was equally conscious
of what he was doing is proven by the fact that in some cases he
makes only too patent an attempt to gloss over the difficulty.
Thus, he makes the chorus in the <i>Electra</i> explain that they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
heard of Achilles’ shield in the nearby harbor of Nauplia “from
one who had fared from Troy” (vss. 452-55); and the Tyrian
maidens justify their knowledge of Theban history by saying that
they “had received an account at home in an alien tongue”
(<i>Phoenician Maids</i>, vs. 819). A curious self-consciousness seems
to obsess dramatic poets and force them to call to the hearer’s
attention the very difficulty that they are striving to avoid.
Like some scientists who think they have explained a phenomenon
if they have provided a name for it, playwrights sometimes
act as if they had justified an incongruity if they mention it. An
excellent modern illustration of this occurs in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, II, 5.
In order to extract the full humor from the scene it is necessary
that Malvolio read aloud the forged letter which he has just
found. Therefore, Shakespeare makes Sir Toby say: “The spirit
of humours intimate reading aloud to him!” Since these words
are uttered in an aside, they can have no real effect. Nevertheless,
the dramatist eased his conscience by inserting them.</p>

<p>Sometimes the difficulty of finding motifs suitable for the
rôle of the chorus caused the playwrights to introduce a second
chorus of a different type. Phrynichus seems to have done this
in 476 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, bringing on a chorus of elders as well as one of
Phoenician women.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Likewise, in Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i> that
hero’s comrades in the chase appear and sing a short ode (vss.
61-72) before the arrival of the regular chorus. Several other
instances are known of in Euripides’ lost plays. In Seneca’s
<i>Agamemnon</i> there is a chorus of Mycenaean women and another
of Trojan captives. In the same writer’s <i>Hercules on Mt. Oeta</i>,
Dr. Fries (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 49) maintains that three choruses are
introduced, one of Oechalian captives at vs. 104, another of
Deianira’s companions at vs. 583, and a third of Hercules’
comrades at vs. 1031. The same sort of thing occurs also in
comedy. Thus, from Terence’s <i>Self-Tormentor</i>, which is a Latin
translation of Menander’s play of the same name, it would
appear that in the Greek original a chorus of banqueting companions
performed at vs. 171 and another chorus of maidservants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
at vss. 409 and 748.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Occasionally, before making its appearance,
the chorus sings, from behind the scenes, in a different
character from that which it later assumes. Aristophanes’
<i>Frogs</i>, for example, derives its name from a chorus which never
is seen. At vs. 209 the chorus, from behind the scenes, delivers
a batrachian strain as an accompaniment to Dionysus and
Charon when they row across the subterranean lake (see <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>,
above). It is not until after vs. 315 that this chorus actually
appears and reveals its true character, that of men and women
who had, when on earth, been initiated into the mysteries. This
method of procedure gained one of two results—it obviated the
necessity either of a lightning change of costume on the part of
the chorus or that of hiring extra choreutae. As to the latter
alternative, whatever may have been true of the tragic poets
(see <a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>, above), there is no reason to suppose that the comic
poets always had spare choreutae at their disposal.</p>

<p>But not only should choral odes be appropriate to the dramatic
character of the chorus; they ought also to be closely
connected with the theme of the play. And this requirement is
no less difficult than the other. The ode on the inventive spirit
of man in Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i>, vss. 334-75, is so vague that an
audience might well be in doubt as to which one of the dramatic
characters it was intended for. Verses 1115-52 in the same
play, a hymn to Dionysus, is quite irrelevant, except in so far
as that divinity was the patron of the dramatic festival. Other
instances are found in Euripides. Verses 1301-68 of <i>Helen</i> deal
with Demeter’s search for her lost daughter and are so alien to
the subject of the tragedy that many have considered them an
interpolation. An adventitious connection is sought, at the
close, by the suggestion that Helen’s misfortunes are due to her
neglect of Demeter’s worship (vss. 1355-57). Again, the chorus’
eulogy of Apollo in <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i>, vss. 1234-83,
is so disconnected with the story that Professor Decharme
(<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 312 f.) could defend it only by saying: “If, therefore,
the chorus wishes not to rouse the suspicion of Thoas, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
must speak of something else than that which really engrosses its
attention. Hence the eulogy of Apollo that compromises nobody,
whose purport Thoas would not understand were he to appear
suddenly, but which the spectator comprehends, provided he reflects.”
The description of Achilles’ armor in Euripides’ <i>Electra</i>,
vss. 434-78, has already been mentioned (<a href="#Page_139">pp. 139 f.</a>, above).
It is as little connected with the plot as it is appropriate to the
chorus of that play. Nevertheless, Euripides brought the ode
back to the theme with a jerk by saying: “The lord of such
warriors didst thou slay, O Clytemnestra” (vss. 479 f.). There
are but two things that can be said to palliate this offense. The
first is to indicate the difficulty of the problem; the other, to
point out that the ingenuity of the ancient playwrights fell short
in only a few plays and seldom more than once in any one piece.</p>

<p>There are certain ways, however, in which the lack of an
organic relationship between chorus and actors or the failure of
the odes to spring naturally from the dramatic situation may be
compensated for or glossed over. One is by giving the choreutae
an active participation in the action. The scene of Euripides’
<i>Helen</i> is laid in Egypt and the chorus consists of Greek slaves,
who assist the heroine in her deception mainly because she is
a fellow-Greek and her victim a barbarian. Their connection,
therefore, is only moderately close and, as we have seen (<a href="#Page_142">p. 142</a>,
above), one of their odes is by some considered an interpolation.
Yet, apart from their choral songs, they take an active and
important part in the play. It is they who persuade Helen not
to believe Teucer’s announcement of her husband’s death but to
consult the seeress Theonoe concerning the matter (vss. 306 and
317). Again, it is they who, when the Egyptian king avows his
intention of murdering Theonoe for abetting his deceivers, grasp
his garments and declare: “We are your slaves and you can slay
us, but slay us you must ere you can kill Theonoe” (vss. 1629 ff.).
Similarly, in Euripides’ <i>Orestes</i> the chorus of Argive women is
friendly toward Electra and her brother but does not share the
danger which threatens them. Yet when Helen is being murdered
behind the scenes, at Electra’s request, in order to guard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
against surprise, it divides into semi-choruses, which picket the
two roads leading before the palace (vss. 1251 ff.). A little later
they attempt to make noise enough to prevent the tumult from
within the palace attracting the notice of the Argive citizens
(vss. 1353 ff.). Thus, a chorus may actively participate in a plot
to which it is but loosely joined. In fact, Professor Capps has
boldly declared: “In every play whose chorus has been criticized
for the irrelevancy of its songs, whether the criticisms have been
just or not, are found indications of direct participation in the
action” (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 295).</p>

<p>In this connection certain words of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> are usually
cited: “The chorus ought to be regarded as one of the actors;
it ought to be an integral part of the whole and take a share in
the action, in the manner, not of Euripides but of Sophocles.
The choral songs of the successors of Euripides and Sophocles
have no more to do with the subject of the piece than with that
of some other tragedy. They are therefore sung as mere intercalary
numbers (ἐμβόλιμα), a practice first begun by Agathon.
Yet this is no more justifiable than to transfer a speech or a
whole act from one tragedy to another.” Aristotle’s praise of
Sophocles at the expense of Euripides probably refers to the
choice and setting of Sophoclean choruses and to the relevancy of
their songs—points in which Sophocles usually surpassed his
rival. Aristotle failed to notice or did not value the other
characteristic of Euripidean choruses, viz., that they have more
effect upon the plot and come into more direct contact with the
actors, that is to say, that they really “act” more, than is the
case in Sophocles. In fact, it is Sophocles’ use of the chorus
which is mainly responsible for the modern notion that the Greek
chorus was merely the “ideal spectator.”</p>

<p>The precise meaning of the latter part of this passage from
the <i>Poetics</i> has not until recently become clear. It is evident
that Aristotle brings the same charge, that of irrelevancy, against
the choruses of both Euripides and Agathon. But if the difference
between them were merely one of <i>degree</i>, he would hardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
have said that Agathon “began” a practice which he had really
borrowed from Euripides and only “developed” or “extended.”
Therefore, Aristotle must mean that Agathon was guilty of a
different <i>kind</i> of irrelevancy than Euripides, and we are now in a
position to see whereof this consisted. Recently discovered
fragments of Menander show that often in New Comedy the
chorus did not appear in the course of the action at all, but only
between acts, and that the poets did not write down the words of
these <i>entr’actes</i> but simply indicated where they should come by
writing the word ΧΟΡΟΥ (“of the chorus”) at the places
required. To the stage manager ΧΟΡΟΥ in the manuscript
would be simply a hint to use anything he chose or to refer to
the poet or that he could rely upon the latter to provide the
choreutae with a libretto, according to whatever arrangement
they had between them on the subject. To the reader it was
convenient, as marking off the divisions of the play. A parallel
to this custom is found in Greene’s <i>James the Fourth</i>, where at
the beginning of Act IV the stage directions read “Enter certain
huntsmen (if you please, singing),” and again at the close of the
same act, “Enter a round, or some dance at pleasure.” A
passage in the ancient <i>Life of Aristophanes</i> had already mentioned
this practice of the writers of New Comedy but had received
scant consideration until substantiated by the Menander fragments.</p>

<p>Now, since embolimon means “something thrown in,” it
seems clear that the songs of the chorus in the intermissions
marked by ΧΟΡΟΥ (if songs not recorded in the text were sung)
would be embolima in Aristotle’s use of the term. I believe
that this was the innovation which Agathon introduced. This
conclusion will be strengthened if we ask ourselves what sort of
evidence enabled Aristotle to attribute the invention of embolima
to Agathon. It is fairly certain that he never saw one of Agathon’s
tragedies actually performed in the theater. Then his
knowledge of Agathon’s dramatic art must have depended upon
the latter’s published works. Therefore, if Agathon’s choral
numbers were notable rather for the music than for the libretto,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
or consisted of music and dancing without words, or were borrowed
from other poets, or if for any reason whatsoever Agathon
preferred not to copy them down with the rest of the text, but
merely to mark their location by ΧΟΡΟΥ or some other symbol,
then we can understand how Aristotle could know that Agathon
had inaugurated something new in dramatic technique. Whatever
their defects of irrelevancy, Euripides’ odes were not
“thrown in” in this sense; they were right there in the text.
But in Agathon’s manuscripts, on the other hand, there were
gaps indicated between acts. In actual performance suitable
odes were “thrown in.” A “thrown-in” ode then would
be one not appearing in the text. It is self-evident that this
interpretation throws a flood of light upon Aristotle’s statements.</p>

<p>That ΧΟΡΟΥ was so used in tragedy prior to the time of
New Comedy is attested by its occurrence in a recent fragment
of a fourth-century <i>Medea</i>.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Moreover, by inference its use
can be safely traced still further back, even close to the period
of Agathon. We have seen that tragedy exercised a profound
influence upon Old Comedy (see <a href="#Page_49">pp. 49 f.</a>, above); and Professor
Navarre<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> has correctly pointed out that the influence of tragedy
was more quickly and strongly felt in the second half of a comedy
(that after the parabasis or, when that is lacking, after the agon;
see <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>, above). Accordingly a strong reason for believing
that this use of ΧΟΡΟΥ originated in tragedy is found in the
fact that ΧΟΡΟΥ occurs in this part of Aristophanes’ last two
(extant) comedies; cf. <i>Women in Council</i>, vss. 729 and 876
(393-392 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and <i>Plutus</i>, vs. 770 (388 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). It is significant
that Aristophanes’ use of embolima is still embryonic, has not
yet been carried to the logical issue found in New Comedy.
That is to say, the chorus of these two plays still figures in the
action and converses with the actors. In the <i>Women in Council</i>
it even has, in addition to embolima, several choral songs, the
words of which are preserved. The fragments of the fourth-century<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
<i>Medea</i>, scanty as they are, nevertheless suffice to indicate
that its author employed embolima and the chorus in the same
fashion as Aristophanes.</p>

<p>But by the time of New Comedy a great change had taken
place. In comedies of this period, or at least in many of them,
the chorus appeared only to furnish entertainment between acts,
withdrawing again at the end of its performance. It bore no
speaking part and from the nature of the case could exercise
no influence upon the plot. Occasionally it was brought into
formal relationship with one of the actors. For example, in
Menander’s <i>Girl with the Shorn Locks</i> the chorus seems to consist
of Polemon’s boon companions, who took breakfast with him in
the country and have now come to his house in the city to be on
hand for the dinner in the evening. This is the most frequent
type of chorus in New Comedy. The approach of these intermezzic
choruses is often mentioned by the actors who thus
motivate their own withdrawal from the scene during the choral
<i>entr’acte</i>. For instance, in one case<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> ΧΟΡΟΥ is prefaced by
one character remarking to another: “Let us withdraw into
Charisius’ home, for a throng of tipsy youths is approaching
whom it is inadvisable to provoke.” Such an introduction
occurs also in a fragment of Alexis, a poet of Middle Comedy,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
but the quotation is not long enough to determine whether
Alexis resembled Aristophanes or the New Comedy in his use of
embolima and of the chorus. Racine’s <i>Athalie</i>, which has been
pronounced<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> the “one thoroughly satisfactory choric drama” that
modern art has produced, presents several points of likeness to
the later Greek chorus. The Levite maidens do not appear until
just before the close of the first act and are withdrawn several
times subsequently, being thus absent from the scene during long
stretches of the dialogue. Their entrances, also, are sometimes
alluded to by the actors. Their songs, however, are not embolima,
but constituent parts of the text.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>We have seen that with reference to the plot these intermezzic
choruses of New Comedy are irrelevant. At times they must
even have been disconcerting. Notwithstanding, in the light
of modern dramatic theory they are not utterly defenseless.
The principle is the same as that which is used to justify intermissions
between acts. “It would be no gain but a loss, if a
whole two hours’ or three hours’ action could be carried through
in one continuous movement, with no relaxation of the strain
upon the attention of the audience, and without a single point
at which the spectator might review what was past and anticipate
what was to come. The act division positively enhances the
amount of pleasurable emotion through which the audience
passes.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>A word of caution is necessary. We have seen that the use
of embolima and of the sign ΧΟΡΟΥ to indicate their position
in the play originated in fifth-century tragedy (Agathon), that
an actual instance of ΧΟΡΟΥ in a fourth-century tragedy is
preserved, and that Aristophanes brought this tragic innovation
over into comedy, where it was greatly extended. Now despite
the fourth-century <i>Medea</i> there is good reason for believing that
this practice never had the vogue in later tragedy that it had in
later comedy. The <i>Rhesus</i> has erroneously come down to us
under the name of Euripides, but is generally regarded by
scholars as the product of some fourth-century writer, the only
complete tragedy of that century which is extant. It contains
no embolima and is a natural continuation of the tradition of
Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The chorus is made up
of the night watch in the Trojan camp. They go to Hector’s
tent and rouse him with the news that the Greek host is on the
move. They take part in the dialogue, almost capture Odysseus,
who has entered the camp as a spy, have a keen personal interest
in the proceedings, and sing choral odes which, though short, are
apposite. It is indisputable that from the beginnings of tragedy
to the end the rôle and importance of the chorus steadily declined,
but there is no reason to suppose that it ever fell so low as was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
the case in New Comedy. This conclusion is confirmed by
Seneca’s Latin tragedies and by the fragments of earlier Roman
tragedies. In the fragments of Ennius, Pacuvius, and Accius
the chorus is shown to be connected, sometimes even intimately
connected, with the plot and some of the characters. It still
conversed with the actors and its odes were not embolima, but
actually written in the text. There are only two signs of a
choral decline. In the first place the odes are no longer characterized
by the elaborate strophic responsion which was seldom
lacking in the choral songs of fifth-century tragedy in Athens.
This doubtless means that the chorus no longer engaged in the
complicated, carefully balanced evolutions which had once
carried the choreutae over the broad expanse of the Greek
orchestra, but sang and danced without moving about so much
or occupying so much space. In the second place there is no
evidence that the chorus and actors were brought into actual
physical contact so frequently as in the fifth-century drama (see
<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>, above). Of course, these changes were not due to physical
conditions, since in the Roman theaters actors and chorus performed
together on a broad, low stage (see <a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>, above). The
Romans seem to have had less appreciation for choral performances
than the Greeks, and the chorus in contemporary Greek
tragedy ought to be thought of as playing even a larger part than
appears from the fragments of Roman tragedy.</p>

<p>The difference between tragedy and comedy in their treatment
of the chorus arises from the innermost nature of each,
as has been well stated by Mr. Cornford: “The comic chorus
has not, from the standpoint of art, the justification and utility
which kept the chorus alive in tragedy to the last days of ancient
drama. In tragedy it is needed for a high function, not to be so
well fulfilled by any other means. It has to utter emotions that
can be expressed only in lyric poetry, to say things which the
audience longs to have said, but which cannot be said by any
character on the stage.... Their function, too, is integral
and need never decay. Nothing of this applies to the comic
chorus. The audience here can completely relieve their feelings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
in laughter; there are no thoughts or emotions stirred that lie
too deep for stage dialogue, no remoter universal meaning to be
caught only in the passionate images of lyric poetry.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Playwrights experience considerable difficulty in plausibly
motivating the entrances of their characters, and this was a more
troublesome problem in ancient times than it is today. I shall
revert to the matter later in connection with the actors (see
<a href="#Page_229">pp. 229 f.</a> and <a href="#Page_239">239</a>, below), but I wish to touch upon it now as
regards the chorus. Of course the chorus was so inevitably
present in every Greek drama that it might be thought needless
to account for its presence at all. As Richter<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> said: “The
chorus in Attic tragedy is so firmly established, so much a matter
of course, that its entrance does not need to be motivated.”
Accordingly, in Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i>, Sophocles’ <i>Philoctetes</i>,
etc., the choral entrance is unmotived. In the <i>Suppliants</i>,
however, the audience scarcely required to be explicitly told
that the sacred precinct with its altars, which is what the
orchestra represents in this play, was a natural place of retreat
for refugees. Likewise it is quite unnecessary for Neoptolemus’
sailors, in the <i>Philoctetes</i>, to give an excuse for following their
prince and captain ashore. On the contrary, in Aeschylus’
<i>Persians</i> there is no self-evident reason why the Persian elders
should go to the tomb of Darius or why Atossa should expect to
meet them there rather than at the palace or the council chamber,
and Aeschylus apparently felt no necessity of inventing a
pretext. Nevertheless, in most instances the Greek playwrights
did motivate their choral entrances. In Aeschylus’ <i>Seven
against Thebes</i> the chorus of maidens, through fear of the invading
host, has fled for protection to the images of the gods on the
acropolis (vss. 214 and 240). In Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus Bound</i>
the ocean nymphs have been drawn to the hero’s side by the
sound of the shackles being bolted upon him (vss. 133 f.). In
the same writer’s <i>Libation-Bearers</i> the maidservants are sent
from the palace with offerings for the grave of Agamemnon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
(vss. 22 f.). In his <i>Eumenides</i> the furies sing their first song
behind the scenes within the temple at Delphi, where they have
been besetting the guilty Orestes; presently Apollo drives them
from his sanctuary into the orchestra (vss. 179 ff.). Often the
chorus enters in response to the cries of the tragic heroine,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> or as
the bearer of news,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> or as the result of hearing a rumor;<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> still
more often in reply to a summons.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> “After going through some
years of Dionysia it must have been hard not to smile, when the
‘shrieks’ were raised or the ‘proclamation’ issued.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> In Aeschylus’
<i>Eumenides</i>, vs. 244, Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, vss.
117 ff., and Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i>, vss. 280 ff., the chorus
comes upon the stage on the track of a transgressor. Occasionally
the pretext is extremely trivial, far-fetched, or improbable.
In Euripides’ <i>Ion</i>, vss. 234 f., Creusa’s handmaidens have
obtained their mistress’ permission to view the sights at Delphi.
The chorus in Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i>, vss. 202 ff., are on
their way from Tyre to Delphi to be consecrated to Apollo’s service
as a thank-offering and chance to be caught in Thebes at the
time of the country’s invasion. In Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i>,
vss. 164 ff. and 187 f., Chalcidian women are constrained by curiosity
to cross the strait and blushingly visit the Greek camp.
In Euripides’ <i>Electra</i>, vss. 168 ff., the choreutae come to invite
Electra to participate with them in an Argive festival in honor
of Hera, and when the princess replies that she has “nothing to
wear,” generously offer to lend her raiment from their store!
Nothing more is heard of this motive during the remainder of
the play. Finally, the same heroine in Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i> intimates
that the women of the chorus have come to soothe her
woes (vss. 129 f.). Now when Aegisthus was home Electra was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
never permitted to leave the palace (cf. vss. 516 ff.). It is only
the accident of his absence which allowed her to pass the doors
on this occasion. But the choreutae were unaware of his
absence (vss. 310 ff.). What reason, then, could they have had
to expect that they would be able to meet Electra outside the
house and comfort her? Sophocles supplies no answer to this
question. Kaibel<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> seems entirely justified in writing: “Ihr
Kommen ist durch nichts motivirt als dadurch, dass ein Chor
nothwendig ist.”</p>

<p>The history and traditions of the Greek theater required a
chorus to appear in each drama. But they also required it to
render several songs at intervals throughout the play. If we
stop to analyze this convention it will surely appear ridiculous
enough. How absurd that the subjects and well-wishers of
kings and princes should resort to singing and dancing at the
crises of their royal fortunes! Dennis<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> sought a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> in the dramatization, <i>à la grecque</i>, of the Spanish
invasion: “Suppose, then, that an express gives notice to Queen
Elizabeth of the landing of the Spaniards upon our coast, and
of great number of subjects revolting and running in to them.
The Queen, upon the reception of this news, falls a lamenting her
condition.... But then, Sir, suppose as soon as the Queen
has left off lamenting, the ladies about her, in their ruffs and
farthingalls, fell a dancing a <i>Saraband</i> to a doleful ditty. Do you
think, Sir, that if this had really happened at White-Hall, it
would have been possible to have beheld it without laughing,
though one had been never so much concerned for his country?”
Nevertheless, despite the incongruity, these odes were so much
a matter of course that usually not even a motivation was
provided for them. Occasionally, however, this was done.
For example, in Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i>, vss. 423 f., Admetus invites
the chorus to “chant an antiphonal strain to the implacable god
below,” and to the balanced strophe and antistrophe of their song
(vss. 435-76) the remains of his wife are borne into the palace.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
In Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i> the furies have tracked Orestes from
Delphi to Athens and at last have overtaken him. But since he
has invoked Athena’s protection and is clasping her image, they
cannot lay hands upon him. Therefore, they resort to a magic
incantation to prevent his escaping them again: at vs. 306 they
announce “you shall hear this spell to bind you,” referring to
and motivating the long ode (vss. 307-96) which follows.
Again, in Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i>, Odysseus asks the chorus to accompany
him and his comrades with a song of good cheer (see below).</p>

<p>Sometimes the noise of fifteen lusty choreutae lifting their
voices in united song sadly interferes with the verisimilitude of
the scene, especially when the dramatic situation imperatively
demands silence. The stricken Orestes, in Euripides’ play of
that name, has at last fallen asleep, guarded by his devoted sister.
Enter the chorus to inquire of his condition. Electra groans as
she catches sight of them, well assured that they will waken
Orestes (vss. 131 ff.). She begs them to be quiet, to stand far
away from his bed, to drop their voices still lower. She inquires
why they have come; warns them that they will be the death of
him if they rouse him; beseeches them to depart, to cease their
chanting. It is all in vain. The chorus enjoin quiet, declare
that they are obeying her biddings, protest that their singing is
but a murmur, invoke winged night to come upon him, etc.
They needs must enter and needs must carry their part of the
lyric dialogue with Electra, until finally (vs. 211) her fears are
realized and Orestes’ slumber is broken. Similarly, in Sophocles’
<i>Philoctetes</i>, Neoptolemus suggests that they give Philoctetes an
opportunity to sleep. But the chorus sings an invocation to
slumber, which under like circumstances in real life could hardly
have had a very soporific effect. Nevertheless, Philoctetes
succumbs to it; whereupon the chorus advise Neoptolemus to
execute his sinister designs, circumspectly enjoining that his reply
to them should be couched in whispered tones! An especially
striking instance occurs in Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i>. At vs. 601
Polyphemus, well filled with powerful wine, has just entered his
cave; Odysseus prays that the liquor will close the monster’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
eyelids in sleep and follows him in. It is not a moment suitable
for any unnecessary noise, such as might tend to keep the
Cyclops awake. But the satyrs, being alone upon the stage,
have no option but to chant an ode (vss. 608-23). At its
conclusion Odysseus rushes in with an expostulation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hush, you wild things, for Heaven’s sake!—still as death!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shut your lips tight together!—not a breath!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Don’t wink, don’t cough, for fear the beast should wake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere we twist out his eye with that red stake.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Yet it is a foregone conclusion that as soon as he leaves the stage
they will be at it once more. How can this difficulty be glossed
over? The poet makes two suggestions. Odysseus wishes the
satyrs to pass in and help gouge out the Cyclops’ eye, but that,
of course, was theatrically impossible; they prefer to sing an
incantation which will plunge the firebrand, of its own accord,
into their victim’s brain (vss. 648 ff.). We have just seen that
magic as a motive passed muster with Aeschylus, but it was
different with Euripides. Odysseus indignantly ignores their
offer, and after a few words of reproach he actually requests them
to cheer on himself and his comrades at their dangerous task
(vs. 653). A choral song in this tenor immediately follows
(vss. 655-62). Thus, within the space of thirty lines, with no
essential change in the situation, Odysseus first commands the
chorus to be quiet and then urges them to sing!</p>

<p>The history and traditions of the Greek theater, the necessity
of delivering songs at frequent intervals, and the difficulty of
motivating the withdrawal of the chorus and its later return to
the scene almost demanded the uninterrupted presence of the
chorus upon the stage. The some half-dozen exceptions that
are known to us outside of New Comedy will be discussed later
(see <a href="#Page_250">pp. 250 f.</a>, below). How unnatural this convention would
be can be realized from Euripides’ <i>Bacchanals</i>, in which Pentheus
arrested Dionysus and took active measures against the Bacchantes
upon Mt. Cithaeron and yet allowed a chorus of the
new god’s devotees (and foreigners at that) to remain practically
unmolested before his palace throughout the play. What a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
baneful effect so rigid and arbitrary a rule had upon any complication
of plot can readily be imagined. The situation was racily
described by Gray:<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> “How could Macbeth and his wife have laid
the design for Duncan’s murder? What could they have said
to each other in the hall at midnight, not only if a chorus, but
if a single mouse, had been stirring there? Could Hamlet have
met the ghost, or taken his mother to task in their company?
If Othello had said a harsh word to his wife before them, would
they not have danced to the window and called the watch?”
In the <i>Agamemnon</i>, Clytemnestra had to address to her returning
lord words of loyal greeting the falsity of which she knew the
chorus was well aware of. Aeschylus strove to surmount the
difficulty by having the queen turn first to the choreutae:
“Reverend citizens of Argos, I feel no shame to mention my
husband-loving ways before you, for as we mortals grow older
we lose such blushing fear” (vss. 855 ff.) We are to suppose
that her effrontery in this and other respects intimidated the
meticulous elders and prevented their denouncing her to Agamemnon.
In Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus the King</i>, Creon is bringing an
oracular response from Delphi and meets the king before the
Theban palace. In reply to Oedipus’ eager question he lets his
eyes rest on the choreutae for a moment and says: “If you would
hear while these are near, I am ready to speak; or else to go
within.” In real life the second alternative probably would have
been adopted; on the Greek stage it was impossible (cf. <a href="#Page_237">pp. 237-41</a>,
below). Accordingly, Oedipus makes answer as follows: “Speak
before all, for I bear more sorrow for these than for my own life”
(vss. 91-94). In Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i>, Orestes discovers himself
and his design to his sister in the presence of the chorus, “so
that he entrusts a secret, upon which his empire and life depends,
in the hands of sixteen women.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The implication is that a body
of women cannot keep a secret under any circumstances. Yet
Sophocles has done what he could. At vs. 1202 Orestes’ identity
is not yet revealed, but his sympathy has begun to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
Electra suspicious. She inquires: “Can it be that you are some
unknown kinsman?” And when Orestes, glancing at the chorus,
replies: “I would answer, if these as friends were present,”
she reassures him by saying: “But they are friends, so that you
can speak without mistrust.” This device was borrowed by
Euripides in his <i>Orestes</i>, vss. 1103 f. Pylades says: “Silence
now, for I put small trust in women,” meaning the chorus; but
Orestes replies: “Fear not, for these are friends to us.”</p>

<p>In general, the constant presence of the chorus bore more
heavily upon Euripides than upon either Aeschylus or Sophocles,
since his plots were more complicated than theirs. Usually
the Euripidean choruses are bound to secrecy by an oath or
promise. But this is only to shift the problem, not to solve it.
In real life groups of people do not take such oaths without an
adequate reason. In his <i>Hippolytus</i>, vss. 710-14, the chorus
swear by Artemis to conceal their knowledge of Phaedra’s guilt,
and they remain true to their oath, though by their so doing the
innocent Hippolytus is brought to ruin and death before their
eyes. But their willingness to take such an oath is without
motive except as one is implied in their kindly feeling toward the
heroine. In Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i> and <i>Helen</i>
the choruses consist of Greek slaves, who would naturally, because
of racial ties, plot against their barbarian masters in order
to help their fellow-countrywomen. Other reasons, however, are
cited. In both plays the actors promise to rescue the chorus as
well as themselves (vss. 1067 f. and 1387 ff., respectively). In
the <i>Iphigenia</i> an additional motive for choral secrecy is found in
an appeal to sex loyalty: “We are women,” says Iphigenia,
“a sex most staunch to one another, most trustworthy in keeping
common counsel” (vss. 1061 f.). The same plea recurs, in an
intensified form, in Euripides’ <i>Medea</i>. Theatrical conditions
compelled Medea to take the chorus into her confidence, and she
bases her request for their silence not only upon the ground of
their common womanhood but also upon the fact that she is
alone, sadly wronged, and in distress (vss. 230-66). But this
chorus consists of Corinthian women in whose sight Medea must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
be a foreigner, nay worse, a barbarian. It is so utterly improbable
that womanly sympathy should cause Greek women to
acquiesce in a barbarian’s plans for the assassination of their
sovereign and his daughter that Professor Verrall<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> supposed a
chorus to have been mechanically added in a subsequent revision
(our present text) to a play originally written for private presentation
without a chorus. On the other hand, the chorus are
occasionally permitted to act as real people would and communicate
their secret. Thus, in Euripides’ <i>Ion</i>, vss. 666 f.,
Xuthus threatens his wife’s handmaidens with death if they
betray to her the supposed fact that Ion is his son. Nevertheless,
this is exactly what they do, declaring to her: “It shall be
told, though I die twice over” (vs. 760); and thus they precipitate
one of the most thrilling scenes in Greek tragedy. This
is a characteristic product of Greek dexterity. Not content
to surmount a troublesome obstacle, they actually derive an
advantage from it.</p>

<p>We have seen that it was practically impossible for the chorus
to leave the scene of action during the play. This convention
was particularly awkward when circumstances arose which
would naturally demand their presence elsewhere. Such a
situation was most frequently brought about by a murder or
suicide just behind the scenes. Up to some thirty years ago an
explanation of the chorus’ failure to pass through the back scene
under such circumstances might be sought in the physical
conditions, since until then it was supposed that the Greek actors
had stood upon a stage ten or twelve feet above the chorus (see
<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>, above). This interpretation never had more than half
a leg to stand upon, inasmuch as the extant plays prove conclusively
that, whatever the physical conditions, intercourse
between actors and chorus was quite feasible and was often
resorted to (see <a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>, above); but it lost the slightest claim to
acceptance after Dörpfeld’s excavations and a re-examination of
the evidence showed that during the classical period of Greek
drama chorus and actors had stood upon the same level (see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
<a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>, above). Moreover, it is illuminating to note that the
chorus found it as difficult to leave the scene of action during
the play by the side entrances as by the doors in the background.
By vs. 1070 of Sophocles’ <i>Philoctetes</i>, Odysseus and Neoptolemus
have gained possession of Heracles’ bow and are preparing to
return to their ship. As the chorus consists of sailors, these
would naturally leave with their commander. But the play
was not to end at this point, and the poet wished the chorus to
sing at vs. 1095. Accordingly, Philoctetes appeals to the chorus
not to desert him (vss. 1070 f.), and upon their referring the
request to Neoptolemus he replies, very improbably, that at the
risk of his being considered soft-hearted they may tarry until
the ship is ready to sail and that possibly by that time Philoctetes
will have decided to accompany them to Troy (vss. 1074-79).
No; the convention was derived from the fact that by origin the
chorus was an integral part of Greek drama and had a rôle to
play which required its continual presence; that is to say, leaving
the stage is not, with rare exceptions, “the kind of action that
a &#60;Greek&#62; chorus can ever perform.”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>But as already intimated, the difficulty arose most frequently
and most glaringly when murder was threatened or was actually
being committed behind the scenes. In such a case “to say that
convention prevented the chorus from entering the palace may be
true; but such a convention was of little assistance to a great
dramatist who keenly felt the force of cause and effect. Such
an artist knows that even convention must be met in a natural
way. Does convention prevent the entrance of the chorus into
the palace? Then common sense and ordinary conduct must
as well, else there is an unreality which is absent in a work of
art” (Stephenson, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 44). As successful a solution of
the problem as any Greek dramatist ever devised occurs in
Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i>. The chorus consists of Argive elders,
who must not be represented as cravenly betraying their lord.
On the other hand, when Agamemnon’s cry of agony is heard at
vs. 1343, they cannot be allowed to rush in and prevent his murder.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
This would alter the whole course of the story and at the
same time would cause an unparalleled lacuna in the action
of the play by leaving the stage, for a considerable interval,
absolutely bare of performers. As soon as Agamemnon’s voice
is heard, the choreutae fall into a wrangle, each declaring his
opinion in turn (vss. 1346-71); but before they can reach a
decision and act upon it, Clytemnestra and the bodies of her
husband and of Cassandra are revealed.</p>

<p>Except that the debate is here so extended, the same device
occurs again and again. In Euripides’ <i>Hecabe</i>, Polymestor has
been enticed within the tents, and cries out that he has been
blinded and his children slain but that his enemies will not
escape (vss. 1034-40). The chorus of Trojan captive women ask
whether they ought not to rush in to help thwart this counter-stroke
(vss. 1042 f.), but at once Hecabe appears and obviates
the need of their entering (vs. 1044). Similarly, in Euripides’
<i>Andromache</i>, vss. 815-19, Hermione’s nurse declares that her
strength has given out in trying to prevent her mistress’ suicide,
and beseeches the chorus to enter the palace and lend their aid.
The slaves acknowledge that they hear the cries of servants from
within, which confirm the nurse’s story; but at this moment
Hermione herself slips from the restraining clutches of her
attendants and darts upon the stage. Less successful is the
scene in Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i>. At vss. 776 ff. a handmaid
raises the cry that Phaedra has hanged herself, and begs someone
to cut her down. One semi-chorus inquires whether they should
not render this service, but the other rejoins that there are
attendants nearer at hand to do so and that officious meddlers
often endanger their own lives! Immediately thereafter a
further cry announces that the queen is dead past recovery (vss.
786 f.). One more illustration will suffice. The failure of the
chorus to rescue Medea’s children is doubly motived: first, by the
Colchian’s threat to anyone that might interfere (Euripides’
<i>Medea</i>, vss. 1053 f.), and secondly, by the fact that the palace
doors are barred, so that Jason’s servants have to break them
down (vss. 1312 ff.). It has also been conjectured that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
chorus’ description of Medea as iron-hearted and like a rock
(vss. 1279 ff.) is intended to suggest that they felt unable to cope
with so masterful and relentless a creature. This explanation
finds some support in the undoubted fact that the necessity of
comparative inactivity on the part of the chorus had much to do
with the Greek tragedians’ fondness for choruses of women and
old men. In speaking of the elders in Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i>
Cornford<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> says that they “cannot enter the palace; not because
the door is locked, nor yet because they are feeble old men.
Rather they are old men because an impassible barrier of convention
is forming between chorus and actors, <i>and their age gives
colour to their powerlessness</i>.” In concluding this paragraph I wish
to point out that the chorus’s inability to enter the background
during the play existed quite independently of the threat of
murder. In Euripides’ <i>Ion</i> Creusa’s maidservants, by the
express permission of their mistress, examine and admire the
sculpture on the outer walls of Apollo’s temple at Delphi (vss.
183-218). In real life it would be inevitable that a crowd bent
on sight-seeing should soon wish to pass inside and view the
omphalus and other objects of interest; and this, of course, the
poet cannot allow. Accordingly, when the point is raised (vss.
219 ff.), Ion replies that it is forbidden to enter the inner fane
except after the offer of sacrifice.</p>

<p>Finally, even at the very end of the play the chorus could not
leave the stage except after the actors or in their company.
This convention arose from the same conditions as have already
been mentioned, but produced some incongruities of its own.
For example, in Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i> and
<i>Helen</i> the Greek slaves in the choruses are promised, as a reward
for their silence and help, a return to Greece (see <a href="#Page_156">p. 156</a>, above).
But since in the latter play Helen and Menelaus make their
final exit nearly five hundred lines before the end of the piece,
it is manifestly impossible for the chorus to be spared. Consequently
they are most unconscionably left in the lurch without
a single word being said of their rescue. In the <i>Iphigenia</i> they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
fare no better up to the time when Orestes’ ship is driven back
to land; but in the final outcome Athena appears and includes
the chorus among those whom King Thoas must allow to depart
in peace (vss. 1467 f.). Possibly a desire to keep this promise to
the chorus was one of the considerations that induced the poet
to have the ship forced back to shore and thus to make a divine
apparition unavoidable.</p>

<p>So inextricably is the chorus interwoven with Greek drama
that its influence may be detected almost anywhere. I have
traced some of the broader effects, however, and in subsequent
chapters minor results will be mentioned in connection with other
factors.</p>

</div>

<p>The dithyramb and the comus, together with their derivatives,
early tragedy and early comedy, were entirely choral. Actors
were first developed in tragedy (see <a href="#Page_16">pp. 16</a> and <a href="#Footnote_105">48, n. 1</a>, above).
Inasmuch as the early dithyramb and early tragedy were devoted
to the worship of Dionysus and since their choreutae were his
attendant sprites (satyrs or sileni), it followed that their songs
would mostly take the form of prayers addressed to him, hymns
in his honor, or odes descriptive of his adventures, sufferings, etc.
A lyric duet between the coryphaeus and the other choreutae
was also possible. Such performances bore much the same
relationship to later tragedy that the modern oratorio bears to a
sacred opera. That is to say, the choreutae were not differentiated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
in character, and there was no dramatic impersonation
(μίμησις); despite their costumes the chorus sang as human
worshipers of Dionysus, not in accordance with their character
as sileni. From the duet between the coryphaeus and the other
choreutae it was only a step, but a highly important one, no
longer to think of the coryphaeus as one silenus among his fellows
but as Dionysus himself in the midst of his followers, and then
to set him off by himself as an actor in contradistinction to the
choreutae and their (new) coryphaeus. This innovation was the
work of Thespis, and however long the name “tragedy” may
already have been applied to the previous performances this step
marked the first beginning of tragedy in the modern sense (see
<a href="#Page_16">p. 16 f.</a>, above). Now that the new actor had to impersonate
Dionysus, the necessity rested likewise upon the sileni in the
chorus to live up to their own, previously neglected, character.
It was not long until by a change of mask and costume the actor
was enabled to represent other personages as well as Dionysus
himself. This practice made possible a much more involved type
of drama than the limited resources would at first glance seem to
permit.</p>

</div>

<p>Aeschylus’ earliest extant play, the <i>Suppliants</i>, belongs to
the two-actor period, but employs the second actor so sparingly
as to afford a very good idea of the possibilities of the one-actor
play. Omitting the choral odes, the action runs as follows: The
fifty daughters of Danaus (the chorus) seek sanctuary near Argos
to escape the unwelcome suit of their cousins. At vs. 176
Danaus begins to admonish his daughters and a dialogue (vss.
204-33) ensues between them. At vs. 234 the king of Argos
enters and engages with the chorus in a dialogue and a lyric duet
(vss. 234-417). During this scene Danaus is present, silent,
inactive, and all but unnoticed; cf. vs. 318. Of course in a
one-actor play this character must have been removed so that
the single actor might reappear as the king. But that could
easily have been managed and would affect the present piece
in no essential way. After an ode the dialogue between the
king and the chorus is resumed (vss. 438-523), broken in upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
only by a brief conversation between the king and Danaus (vss.
480-503). The former instructs Danaus how to supplicate the
citizens in the town and, upon the latter’s request for protection,
orders attendants to accompany him. Here for the first time
are the two actors simultaneously employed, but their words
serve no more important purpose than to motivate the exit of
one of them. At vs. 523 the king likewise withdraws. At
vs. 600 Danaus reappears and with but a slight interruption on
the part of his daughters (vss. 602-4) informs them that the
Argives have decided to shield them (vss. 600 f., 605-24). At
vs. 710 Danaus descries the suitors’ fleet in the distance and
declares, “I will return with helpers and defenders” (vs. 726).
Nevertheless, the scene is continued until vs. 775, when Danaus
departs to spread the alarm, incidentally releasing this actor to
play the part of the suitors’ herald. At vs. 836 the herald enters
and to the accompaniment of a lyric duet between himself and
the chorus tries to drag the Danaids away. At vs. 907 this
attempt at violence is brought to a standstill by the king’s
return. The following altercation between the herald and the
king (vss. 907-53) provides the only bit of genuine dramatic
conflict, visually represented, in the play and the only instance
of both actors being fully made use of together. In a one-actor
play such a passage would have been impossible but could have
been presented indirectly by means of a messenger’s narrative.
At vs. 953 the herald withdraws, discomforted, and the king
turns to the chorus (vss. 954-65). In reply the chorus ask that
their father be returned to them (vss. 966 ff.). The interval
having been sufficient to enable the actor to shift from the mask
and costume of the herald to those of Danaus, the latter re-enters
at vs. 980 and converses with his daughters until the final ode.
Of all the extant plays of Aeschylus the <i>Suppliants</i> probably
makes the slightest appeal to the modern student. Its principal
value for us lies in the fact that it could readily be revamped for
presentation by one actor and in the light which it thus sheds
upon the character of one-actor drama.</p>

<p>Several times in this play, as appears from the foregoing
outline, an actor participates in a dialogue with the chorus. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
was not the practice for the choral part in such dialogues to be
spoken by all the choreutae in unison, but by the chorus leader
alone. Thus, though a sharp distinction was drawn between
actors and chorus, the former being furnished by the state and the
latter by private means (cf. <a href="#Page_270">pp. 270 f.</a>, below), yet the coryphaeus
served as a bond of connection between the two. We have seen
how the first actor was developed from the chorus leader;
doubtless the successive additions to the number of actors were
suggested in each case by the advantages arising from this
quasi-histrionic function of the coryphaeus. Thus in addition
to the regular actors, at each stage of development the tragic
poet always had at his disposal also one quasi-actor for carrying
on his dialogues. And the comic poet always had two such
quasi-actors, since the leaders of the two semi-choruses could
be used in this way (see <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>, above). In the one-actor period
this quasi-histrionic function of the coryphaeus resulted in a
convention which continued long after the necessity for it had
passed away. It is obvious that at that juncture the single actor
could converse with no one but the chorus. This practice became
so stereotyped that in the two-actor period whenever a character
came into the presence of the chorus and another actor he directed
his remarks to the chorus before turning to the other character.
Of course oftentimes this was the natural thing to do. But the
force of tradition is seen in the fact that the principle was
sometimes observed under unfavorable conditions. Thus, as
we have already observed, in the <i>Suppliants</i> the king enters at
vs. 234 and at once begins a dialogue with the chorus, ignoring
their father until vs. 480. Greek respect for age and partiality
for the masculine sex make this arrangement in a Greek play
very unnatural. Again, in the <i>Persians</i> a messenger from Greece
ignores his queen (vss. 249 ff.) and reports the Persian disaster
to the chorus of elders. Not until vs. 290 does Atossa address
him, and in typical Greek fashion Aeschylus strives to make her
words gloss over the unreality of his characters’ compliance with
convention. “For a long time have I kept silence,” she begins,
“dumbfounded by catastrophe. This ill exceeds my power to
tell or ask our woes.” The same convention persisted even into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
the three-actor period. Clytemnestra’s husband has been gone
ten years or more, yet she must excuse herself to the chorus
(Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i>, vss. 855-78) before greeting her lord
(see <a href="#Page_155">p. 155</a>, above). Another instance occurs in Euripides’
<i>Children of Heracles</i>, vss. 120 ff. Moreover the coryphaeus
sometimes exercises an important influence upon the plot. For
example, in Aeschylus’ <i>Libation-Bearers</i>, vss. 766 ff., it is the
coryphaeus who induces the servant to alter the wording of the
summons with which she is sent to Aegisthus. By this device
he comes unescorted and falls an easy victim to the conspirators.</p>

<p>In view of the normal employment of the coryphaeus as a
quasi-actor, Aeschylus took an easy and obvious step, or rather
half-step, in advance when he introduced the second actor. We
have seen that the <i>deuteragonist</i> was already made use of, though
sparingly, in the <i>Suppliants</i>. Also the <i>Persians</i>, the <i>Seven
against Thebes</i> (except possibly the closing scene; see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>,
below), and the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> require but two actors for
presentation. The great advantage accruing from the second
actor is manifest. Instead of being compelled to resort to a
messenger’s report of an altercation or dialogue between two
personages, the playwright was now enabled to bring the characters
face to face in person upon his stage. On the other hand,
so limited a number of actors often seriously embarrassed the
dramatist in the economy of his play. Perhaps the best example
of this is afforded by Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus</i>. In the opening
scene Cratos and Bia (Strength and Force) drag Prometheus to a
remote spot in Scythia and Hephaestus nails him to a crag.
How can these four characters be presented by two actors? In
the first place Bia has no speaking part, and mutes were freely
employed in addition to the regular actors. In the second place
Prometheus was represented by a wooden figure. This explains
how it was possible for a nail to be driven right through his
breast (vss. 64 f.). It explains also why so great emphasis is
laid upon the fastening process; first the hands are pinned down
(vs. 55), then the arms (vs. 60), the breast (vs. 65) and sides (vs.
71), and finally the legs (vs. 74). Thus the immobility and lifelessness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
of the supposed Prometheus are accounted for. Neither
Hephaestus’ sympathy nor Cratos’ insults elicit a single word of
reply from his lips. Although this silence arises naturally from
the Titan’s unyielding disposition, yet the real reason lies in the
use of a dummy. At vs. 81 Hephaestus retires, and after six
lines of further insults Cratos follows him. A slight pause would
naturally ensue, so that Prometheus might be sure that his enemy
had passed beyond the sound of his voice. These intervals
enabled the former actor to take his place at some crack or
opening behind the lay figure and break Prometheus’ speechlessness
(vs. 88). The other actor reappears in a succession of
rôles throughout the play, as Oceanus (vs. 284), Io (vs. 561),
and Hermes (vs. 944); but these shifts were easily managed.</p>

<p>Soon after Sophocles’ first appearance (468 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> or possibly
471 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> he introduced the third actor. First of all this innovation
permitted a larger number of characters to be presented.
In Aeschylus’ two-actor plays the characters number three in the
<i>Suppliants</i> in addition to the chorus and coryphaeus, four in the
<i>Persians</i>, six in the <i>Prometheus</i>, and five in <i>Seven against Thebes</i>.
In the three-actor plays Aeschylus’ characters range from five to
seven, Sophocles’ from five to nine, and Euripides’ from seven
to eleven, except that Euripides’ satyr-play, the <i>Cyclops</i>, has
but three characters. Secondly, a third actor allowed greater
flexibility in handling entrances and exits. An artificial pause,
more or less improbably motived, to enable an actor to change
his mask and costume before appearing in another rôle would
now be less frequently required (see further, <a href="#Page_231">p. 231</a>, below).
Thirdly, it allowed three personages to appear side by side in the
same scene, whereby in turn a certain aesthetic effect became
possible. I refer to the varied emotions which one actor’s
statements or conduct sometimes produce in two other characters.
An excellent illustration is afforded by the scene with
the Corinthian messenger in Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus the King</i>, vss.
924 ff. As the awful conviction is brought home to Jocaste that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Oedipus is her son as well as her husband, she rushes from the
stage to hang herself; but Oedipus, on the contrary, still lacking
the fatal clue, becomes elated at the prospect of discovering his
parents’ identity. Similarly in the same playwright’s <i>Electra</i>,
vss. 660 ff., the false report of Orestes’ death cheers his mother
with the assurance that her murder of Agamemnon must now
remain unavenged, but plunges Electra into the desperation of
despair. Such situations would have been impossible in the
two-actor drama. Finally, the introduction of a third actor
contributed to the decay of the chorus. We have already noted
in the last chapter how the importance of the chorus steadily
declined, especially in comedy. But this change was quantitative
as well as qualitative. In the prehistrionic period the
chorus and its coryphaeus, from the nature of the case, monopolized
every line. After Thespis had brought in the first actor
the chorus yielded but a small place to its rival. Even in the
two-actor period in our earliest extant play, the <i>Suppliants</i>,
the chorus sang five hundred and sixty-five verses out of a total
of a thousand and seventy-four, and in addition to this the
coryphaeus spoke ninety verses. In six of Aeschylus’ seven
extant pieces the choral element varies from three-fifths to about
one-half of the whole play. The <i>Prometheus</i>, for special reasons,
is exceptional, the fraction being only one-sixth. The effect
of the third actor is seen in the fact that in Sophocles the proportion
varies from one-fourth to one-seventh and in Euripides from
one-fourth to one-eighth.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises, Why were the Greek dramatists
so slow in increasing the number of actors? This was due
partly to a paucity of histrionic talent and partly to difficulty
in mastering the dramatic technique of the dialogue.</p>

<p>In the dithyramb and the prehistrionic drama the poet was
his own coryphaeus. Accordingly when Thespis introduced the
first actor he served in that capacity himself, appointing another
as coryphaeus. So did Phrynichus, Aeschylus, and the other
dramatists of that period. Since there were then no retired
actors and no opportunity to serve an apprenticeship, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
obvious that these early poets had to teach themselves how to
act. At this stage it was not possible for anyone except a playwright
to become an actor, and actors must have been correspondingly
scarce. The situation improved somewhat after
Aeschylus introduced the second actor, for though the poets still
carried the major rôles it now became possible for men with
natural histrionic ability to develop it and gain experience in
minor parts. By the time of Sophocles, actors had become so
plentiful, relatively speaking, that he could increase the number
employed by each poet from two to three and could retire from
personal participation in the public presentation of his works.
His weak voice is said to have been responsible for this second
innovation; but he occasionally appeared in scenes where this
weakness was no great hindrance, e.g., as a harp player in
<i>Thamyris</i> and as an expert ball player in <i>Nausicaa</i>. By 449 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
the profession was so large and its standing so well recognized
that a contest of tragic actors was made an annual event in the
program of the City Dionysia. This course of development
reveals one reason for the long duration of the one- and two-actor
stages in Greek drama.</p>

<p>We shall now pass to the second reason. In the prehistrionic
period a series of lyric questions and answers between chorus and
coryphaeus was the nearest approach to a dialogue that was
possible (see <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>, above). With the invention of the first
actor this interplay of question and answer, still lyrical in form,
could be carried on by the actor and the chorus (including the
coryphaeus). Such a duet, which came to be known as a
<i>commus</i>, continued in use, especially for dirges, as long as the
chorus lasted. Side by side with this, however, there quickly
developed a non-lyric interchange of spoken lines between actor
and coryphaeus. But not until the second actor was added did
true dialogue in the modern sense become possible. Yet the
poets could not at once make full use of even these simple
resources. Our analysis of Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i> (<a href="#Page_163">pp. 163 f.</a>,
above) shows that in two instances Danaus stood silent and unaddressed
during a conversation between the other actor and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
coryphaeus. Moreover, priority of usage constrained the playwrights
to give the actor-coryphaeus dialogue precedence over
actor-actor dialogue (cf. <a href="#Page_165">pp. 165 f.</a>, above). They seemed unable
to weld the two types together with a technique which would
employ all three persons at once. In the three-actor period the
embarrassment of riches made their helplessness the more
striking. “A” might engage in a dialogue with “B” while
“C” remained inactive; then with “C” while “B” was silent;
and finally “B” and “C” might converse, with “A” remaining
passive. Often the transitions are marked or the longer speeches
set off by a few more or less perfunctory verses (usually two)
spoken by the coryphaeus. The type is not frequently worked
out as completely as I have just indicated, but the principle is
illustrated on a lesser scale in almost every play. Compare, for
example, Euripides’ <i>Helen</i>, vss. 1186-1300, and <i>Andromache</i>,
vss. 547-766. Such an arrangement, needless to say, falls far
short of a genuine trialogue or tetralogue. Yet we must not be
unfair in condemning this practice. The Greek poets were
feeling their way and could not immediately attain to every
refinement. Even in Shakespeare and the modern drama,
despite centuries of continuous experimentation and the numerous
examples of superior technique, the tandem arrangement of
dialogue is still not uncommon.</p>

<p>A half-step in advance consisted in the silent actor interrupting
the dialogue with some electrifying utterance. For example,
in Aeschylus’ <i>Libation-Bearers</i> (458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), Clytemnestra’s appeal
to Orestes on the score of her motherhood stays his hand in the
very act of murdering her, and he weakly turns to his trusted
friend, Pylades, for guidance. The latter’s ringing response,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wilt thou abjure half Loxias’ behest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The word of Pytho, and thy sacred troth?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hold all the world thy foe rather than Heaven</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[vss. 900-903, Warr’s translation],</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is as effective as if uttered by the god in person, and urges Orestes
on to the deadly deed. These are the only words that Pylades
utters in the whole tragedy. In another play belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
same trilogy, the <i>Eumenides</i>, Aeschylus rose to the full possibilities
of his histrionic resources—Orestes, the coryphaeus,
Apollo, and Athena all participating in the conversation between
vss. 746 and 753. Similarly, in Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>,
Antigone, Oedipus, Ismene, and the coryphaeus all speak between
vss. 494 and 506, and in Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i> the herald, the
coryphaeus, Adrastus, and Theseus divide four lines among
them (vss. 510-13). But after all, such instances are comparatively
rare and seldom extend over a very long passage.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to tragic practice Aristophanes in the
last quarter of the fifth century employed not merely three but
occasionally even four comic actors in ensemble scenes. For
example, in the <i>Lysistrata</i>, vss. 78-246, Calonice, Myrrhina,
Lysistrata, and Lampito engage in a running fire of conversation
quite in the modern manner. Again, in the <i>Frogs</i>, vss. 1411 ff.,
Dionysus, Aeschylus, Euripides, and Pluto all have speaking
parts, although the last two do not address one another. In the
same play (vs. 555) Dionysus utters three words while three other
participants in the dialogue are present. Under similar circumstances
Pseudartabus interposes two verses (100 and 104) in the
<i>Acharnians</i>, and Triballus parts of five verses (1615, 1628 f., and
1678 f.) in the <i>Birds</i>. In these passages the comic coryphaei
have no speaking parts. Trialogues are not so rare in Old
Comedy as to justify an enumeration of the instances, and they
are sometimes embellished by the participation of the coryphaei.
Nevertheless, the old tandem arrangement is still the more
common one when three characters are present.</p>

<p>We thus pass from one problem to another: Why this disparity
between the technique of tragedy and comedy? Must
we suppose that the comic dramatists were more clever artists
than their tragic confrères? By no means. Comedy was more
mobile and reacted more quickly to the actual conditions of
contemporaneous life; tragedy was more conventional, never
could free itself entirely from the power of tradition, and could
only slowly modify that tradition. The situation is clearly
revealed in the field of meter. In the iambic trimeters written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
by Aeschylus a trisyllabic substitution (tribrach, anapaest, or
dactyl) for the pure disyllabic iambus occurs only once in about
twenty-five verses. In the earliest plays of Euripides such
resolutions appear once in sixteen verses but gradually increase
to a maximum of one in every alternate verse.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> On the contrary,
in the comedies of Aristophanes they are found in almost every
line. Now we are not to suppose that Euripides required a
lifetime in order to learn how to use resolutions with freedom or
that he was never able to gain the facility of Aristophanes. Nor
are we to suppose that Sophocles, whose iambics resemble those
of Aeschylus, was never able to master this expedient. In both
cases we see merely the power which convention and tradition
exercised over tragedy. And the same influences made themselves
felt in the comparatively archaic technique of tragic
dialogue and tended to keep the tragic playwrights from making
full use of their resources.</p>

<p>But were the resources of the tragic writers as great as those
of the comedians? We have seen how the first, second, and
third actors were added to Greek tragedy. Is there reason to
believe that the tragedians of Athens ever followed the comedians
in employing a larger number? Until recently a negative reply
to this has been accepted without serious question, but in 1908
Professor Rees challenged the tradition. Three years later the
old view was defended by Dr. Kaffenberger. Although neither
has been able fully to establish his contentions, yet the discussion
has helped to clear the air, defined the issues more sharply, and
really settled certain important points. For one thing, since
1844 it has generally been taken for granted that three actors
were the maximum for Old Comedy as well as for tragedy. But
the passages just cited from Aristophanes would seem to be
decisive against this view, and all the objections to the presentation
of Greek tragedy by only three actors apply with still
greater force to Old Comedy. Even Dr. Kaffenberger (<i>op. cit.</i>,
pp. 9 f.) accepts this conclusion, and it is an invaluable result
of Professor Rees’s investigations that he has banished this phase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
of the subject from the field of controversy. Moreover, they are
both agreed<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> that a fourth actor seems sometimes to be required
also for New Comedy. It must be added, however, that Dr. Graf
(<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 29 ff.) dissents. But in any case the question has
been restricted, so far as the fifth century is concerned, to the
practice in tragedy.</p>

<p>It can be said at once that if we are willing to grant that the
Greeks made use of certain desperate expedients it is physically
possible to stage all the extant tragedies with three actors. But
these expedients are so offensive to modern feeling as to be
tolerable only as a last resort. It will be best to begin at a point
where comparative agreement is possible, viz., with Aeschylus’
earlier plays, which nearly everyone would admit were intended
for two actors alone. Do they reveal any indication of this
limitation?</p>

<p>In the analysis of Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i> on <a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>, the reader
will remember that Danaus, having declared “I will return with
helpers and defenders,” took his departure at vs. 775; after an
ode, the suitors’ herald arrived on the scene (vs. 836) but was
balked by the entrance of the Argive king (vs. 907). One would
surely expect Danaus to accompany the king, but as a matter
of fact he does not reappear until vs. 980. The reason for this is
plain—Danaus and the herald are played by the same actor, and
consequently the former can return only after the latter’s
departure at vs. 953. Moreover, Aeschylus sought to gloss over
the blemish by having Danaus refer in advance to the possibility
of his being slow in spreading the alarm (vs. 730) and by having
the chorus request the king to send their father back to them
(vss. 968 ff.), as if his absence had been perfectly natural. This
incident teaches us four things: (1) A single actor could carry
several rôles; the simplicity and sameness of ancient costumes
and the ease of slipping them off and on, together with the use of
masks by the actors, made this practice more feasible than it is
with us. Overzealous classicists have not merely asked us to
tolerate this practice but even to admire its results. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
when one character returns to report the death of another the
spectators are supposed to have been doubly moved if they could
penetrate the messenger’s disguise and from the identity of
stature, build, and voice recognize the ghost, as it were, of the
departed visibly before them (!).<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> (2) This practice oftentimes
necessitated the arbitrary withdrawal of a character from the scene
of action and his enforced absence when he would naturally be
present. (3) By inventing an inner reason for this the poet strove
to conceal or gloss over his yielding to external need. (4) The
intervals between the withdrawal of Danaus and the entrance of
the herald (vss. 776-836) and vice versa (vss. 953-80) afford an
inkling as to the length of time required for such shifts in rôles.</p>

<p>Further information is derived from Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus
Bound</i> (see <a href="#Page_166">pp. 166 f.</a>, above). (5) Supernumeraries may be employed
for silent parts, e.g., that of Bia. (6) A part may be divided
between a lay figure and an actor, as in the case of Prometheus
himself. From the nature of things, this expedient would not
be frequently employed; but an analogous device (6<i>a</i>) is
common, viz., to give the silent portions of a rôle to a mute and
the speaking portions to an actor. (7) The stubborn silence of
the mutes and supernumeraries employed according to principles
(5) and (6<i>a</i>) is sometimes extremely embarrassing and difficult to
motivate. (4<i>a</i>) The interval required for a “lightning” change
from one character to another was much shorter than the
<i>Suppliants</i> led us to suppose. Six verses and a slight pause in
the action enabled the actor impersonating Hephaestus to withdraw
by the side entrance after vs. 81 and to get in position to
speak from behind the wooden figure of Prometheus at vs. 88.
This conclusion is confirmed by certain evidence in Plautus’
translation of Greek comedies, which indicates that about thirteen
lines would suffice.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>Still other principles are derivable from Aeschylus’ <i>Persians</i>.
The ghost of Darius having requested his widow to meet their
son Xerxes with a change of raiment, Atossa replies (vss. 849 ff.):
“I shall endeavor to meet my son ... and,” turning to the
chorus, “if he comes hither before me, do you comfort him and
escort him to his palace.” These words are clearly intended to
prepare us for her failure to appear in the dénouement, and in
fact she does not appear. But since one of the two actors is
disengaged in the final scene, at first glance there seems to be no
external reason for her absence. It is evident that Aeschylus
valued the parts of Atossa and Xerxes so highly that he wanted
them both played by the better of his two actors, the <i>protagonist</i>.
If Atossa had appeared with her son, she must have been impersonated
by a different actor than in the opening scenes. The
poet preferred to sacrifice verisimilitude somewhat rather than
to “split” Atossa’s rôle in this fashion. Hence, we must conclude
(8) that at any cost star parts were reserved for the leading
actor, (9) that split rôles were to be avoided, and (10) that
sometimes for purely technical reasons the dramatist would
unnaturally keep a character off the stage entirely in certain
scenes.</p>

<p>If we could be sure that the final scene of Aeschylus’ <i>Seven
against Thebes</i> is genuine, it would be possible to deduce a final
principle. The main support for the charge of interpolation is
that this scene in a two-actor play apparently requires three
actors. From vs. 961 to vs. 1004 Antigone and Ismene engage
in a lyric duet; at vs. 1005 a herald enters and converses with
Antigone. From this scene, which I am inclined to accept as
genuine (see <a href="#Page_283">p. 283</a>, below), we must concede either that a supernumerary
could occasionally bear a brief singing (or speaking)
part or preferably that the herald, standing in the side entrance
concealed from the spectators and already dressed for his own
rôle, sang Ismene’s share of the duet while a mute went through
the dumb show of her part before the audience; at the conclusion
of the duet he promptly appeared <i>in propria persona</i>. Though
the latter alternative is offensive to present-day taste, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
unparalleled in the annals of the modern stage.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> In any case
one of these alternatives is the last principle (11) to be drawn
from the two-actor drama.</p>

<p>Now these eleven principles are so manifestly operative in the
other Greek tragedies as to raise an irresistible presumption that
some restriction (to three or at most to four actors) applied also
to them. It would obviously be out of place to pass every play
in review here; I must content myself with a few typical illustrations
and then consider the crucial cases.</p>

<p>In order to avenge his daughter, Menelaus is on the point of
murdering her rival (Andromache) and the latter’s son when he
is interrupted by the arrival of Peleus, Hermione’s father-in-law.
There is no reason why Menelaus should fear the old man’s
blusterings; nevertheless he suddenly leaves Hermione in the
lurch and takes his departure with the words:</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Euripides <i>Andromache</i>, vss. 732 ff., Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Surely no excuse was ever less convincing than this! No wonder
Professor Verrall’s ingenuity has built up a whole reinterpretation
of the play around it.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The real reason for the sudden leave-taking
is only too apparent—Orestes is presently to make his
appearance (vs. 881) and Menelaus’ actor is required for his
rôle. This exemplifies principles (1), (2), and (3).</p>

<p>Again, in Sophocles’ <i>Maidens of Trachis</i>, Lichas, Deianira, and
a messenger are on the scene when Deianira spies Iole in a
throng of captives and questions her (vss. 307 ff.). Iole makes
no reply whatsoever. Lichas explains her refusal to answer by
stating that from grief and weeping she has not uttered a word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
since leaving her fatherland (vss. 322 ff.). Since the three actors
are already occupied in this scene it is evident that Iole is played
by a mute and cannot speak. This illustrates principles (5)
and (7).</p>

<p>Still again, up to vs. 1245 of Euripides’ <i>Orestes</i>, when he
enters the palace, Pylades speaks freely. At vs. 1554 Menelaus,
Orestes, Hermione, and Pylades enter the scene. The last two
are now played by mutes, the third actor appearing as Apollo at
vs. 1625. Orestes threatens to kill Hermione; and after vainly
striving to deter him Menelaus turns to Pylades with the query
(vs. 1591): “Do you, also, share in this murder, Pylades?”
What is a mute to do under such circumstances? Orestes
relieved the situation by saying: “His silence gives consent;
my word will suffice.” There can be no doubt that the playwright
intended Menelaus’ question to create the illusion that
Pylades could have spoken had he so desired, principles (6<i>a</i>)
and (7).</p>

<p>Euripides avoided an awkward silence of this sort in the <i>Ion</i>
by leaving Xuthus unrepresented in the final scene, where the
three actors speak in other rôles. Xuthus takes his final departure
at vs. 675, intending to celebrate for his new-found son a
public feast from which the host himself is most strangely
absent. The poet prepares us in advance for this contingency
by means of Xuthus’ words to his son, as reported by a servant
at vss. 1130 ff.: “If I tarry in sacrificing to the Birth-gods,” a
thin pretext, “place the feast before the friends assembled there,”
principles (1), (2), (3), and (10).</p>

<p>Finally, for the presentation of his <i>Phoenician Maids</i>, Euripides
must have had a leading actor of great musical attainments.
For such a performer the rôles of Jocaste and Antigone
were especially adapted, and he seems to have played them both,
principle (8). The piece opens with a soliloquy by Jocaste,
who withdraws at vs. 87. Immediately a servant appears on
the palace roof and tells Antigone to tarry upon the stairs until
he can assure himself that there is no one near to see her and to
spread scandalous reports of her indiscretion. Thus, Antigone’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
appearance is delayed for fifteen verses (vss. 88-102), which is
sufficient to enable Jocaste’s actor to shift to the new rôle,
principle (4<i>a</i>). The protagonist continues to play both parts
without difficulty, except at vss. 1264 ff. Here Jocaste summons
her daughter from the palace and both are present during vss.
1270-82, the latter speaking some six verses. Obviously Antigone’s
lines in this brief scene must have been delivered by one of
the subordinate players, though such splitting of a rôle violates
Aeschylean practice, see principle (9). Perhaps the procedure
in this case was condoned by the fact that Antigone’s part
previously and (for the most part) subsequently was entirely
lyric, while her few words here are in plain iambics. The difference
between the singing and the speaking voice would help
to conceal the temporary substitution of another actor. It is
true that by assigning Jocaste’s and Antigone’s rôles to different
actors throughout it is possible to distribute the parts in this
play among three actors without any difficulty whatever. But
this would require us to ignore the peculiar technique of the
opening scenes, the true inwardness of which was recognized by
ancient commentators.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>These examples are by no means exhaustive, but it is high
time that we turn to the passages which are of crucial importance
to the three-actor theory. In Aeschylus’ <i>Libation-Bearers</i> a
servant has just informed Clytemnestra that her paramour is
slain, and she cries out: “Let some one quickly give me an ax
to slay a man withal” (vs. 889). We are to suppose that the
slave at once makes his exit to comply with her command.
She speaks two lines more and Orestes enters. They divide
seven more lines between them, and Orestes’ purpose is beginning
to waver when he catches sight of Pylades entering and asks:
“Pylades, what shall I do? Shrink from killing my mother?”
Pylades’ electrifying response has already been quoted (vss.
900-902; see <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>, above). Here we have four speaking characters
between vss. 886 and 900 and consequently four actors,
unless the servant can be transformed into Pylades within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
space of nine lines, vss. 891-99. This would be a “lightning”
change indeed (4<i>a</i>), and it is not surprising that it has been
challenged. Yet the ancient scholiast accepts it and I do not
believe we are warranted in pronouncing it impossible, especially
since the shift is merely from one male character to another.</p>

<p>Another sort of difficulty is presented by Euripides’ <i>Andromache</i>.
Menelaus, Andromache, and her son, Molossus, all have
speaking (or singing) parts just before the entrance of Peleus
at vs. 547. Since none of the earlier speakers has withdrawn
and since Peleus at once begins to talk, it would seem at first
glance that we had four actors indisputably before us. Not
so, answer the defenders of the traditional view, for it is significant
that Molossus becomes utterly dumb after Peleus enters.
Therefore we are asked to believe that Molossus was played by
a mute throughout, and the actor who is presently to appear as
Peleus delivered from behind the scenes the words which belong
to Molossus, the mute furnishing only the gestures. We have
already found support for this kind of thing in a suspected scene
of Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i>, principle (11), second alternative
(<a href="#Page_175">pp. 175 f.</a>). But we are asked to go further and believe that
this was always the practice when children seemed to sing or
speak upon the Greek stage;<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and in confirmation of this it is
pointed out that whenever children have a part, as in Euripides’
<i>Alcestis</i>, vss. 393 ff. and <i>Medea</i>, vss. 1271 ff., one of the actors is
always off the scene and available for this purpose. The most
difficult example of this problem has recently come to light in the
fragments of Euripides’ <i>Hypsipyle</i>, vss. 1579 ff.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The heroine
and Amphiaraus converse from the beginning of the fragment to
vs. 1589, where the latter makes his exit. Two lines of farewell
(vss. 1590 f.) are addressed to him and are assigned by the
papyrus to “the children of Hypsipyle.” Moreover, they are
of such a nature that one line must have been spoken by each
of the two youths. Next, <i>one</i> of them converses with his mother
until Thoas, who also has a speaking part, appears at vs. 1632.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
Here, then, if the children’s parts are taken by actors we have
four actors required in two successive scenes. The only alternative
lies in supposing that mutes impersonated the boys and
that Thoas’ actor, already dressed for his introit at vs. 1632,
spoke their lines from behind the scenes. This would include
twelve lines for one youth and one line, <i>in a different voice</i>, for
the other.</p>

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>—Distribution of
  Rôles to Actors in Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i></p>
</div>

<p>But the most intractable play of all is Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus at
Colonus</i>. Antigone and Oedipus are on the stage continuously
for the first eight hundred and forty-seven verses (the latter until
vs. 1555), while the third actor appears successively as a stranger,
Ismene, Theseus, and Creon (<a href="#figure67">Fig. 67</a>). So far there is no difficulty;
but at this point Creon hopes to bring Oedipus to time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
by announcing that his guards have already seized Ismene (off-scene)
and by having them now drag Antigone away. Creon
threatens to carry off Oedipus as well, but at vs. 887 Theseus
reappears and prevents further outrage. Note, however, that
if only three actors were available Theseus must now be impersonated
by Antigone’s actor, whereas previously he was represented
by the actor who is now playing Creon’s part. Such
splitting of a rôle is directly contrary to Aeschylean practice,
principle (9), and has not in this instance the justification which
Euripides had for splitting Antigone’s part in the <i>Phoenician
Maids</i> (<a href="#Page_178">p. 178</a>, above). For Theseus’ second actor participates in
the dialogue more extensively than did hers and his lines are
prose throughout, while hers were entirely prose for one actor
and (almost) entirely lyric for the other. But there are still other
obstacles ahead. At vs. 1043 Creon and Theseus withdraw;
after a choral ode Antigone, Theseus, and Ismene rejoin Oedipus
(vs. 1099). Inasmuch as Ismene now has no speaking part she
is evidently played by a mute, principle (6<i>a</i>). Presumably the
other two are represented by the same actors as at the beginning,
although this second transfer in Theseus’ rôle doubles the
chances of the audience noticing the shift. The only alternative,
however, is to split also Antigone’s rôle at this point. Theseus
retires at vs. 1210 and reappears at vs. 1500, his actor having
impersonated Polynices in the interval (vss. 1254-1446). At
vs. 1555 all the characters exeunt. In the final act a messenger
is on the stage from vs. 1578 to vs. 1669. Since Antigone and
Ismene enter immediately thereafter (vs. 1670), it is necessary
to suppose that they are played by the same actors as at the
beginning and that Oedipus has become the messenger. At vs.
1751 Theseus makes his final entrance, represented this time by
Oedipus’ actor, so that this important rôle is played in turn by
each of the three actors! This means splitting Theseus’ rôle
twice. It is also possible to split his rôle and Ismene’s (or
Antigone’s) once each, or to split his rôle once and to have the
final actor in this part sing from behind the scenes the few
words which fall to Ismene just before Theseus’ last entrance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
principle (11). On the other hand, though a fourth actor would
obviate all these difficulties we should then have no explanation
for the complicated system of entrances and exits and for the
strange silence of Ismene during vss. 1099-1555, especially
during vss. 1457-99 (see <a href="#Page_187">p. 187</a>, below).</p>

<p>I do not consider it warrantable to draw a categorical conclusion
from the data considered in the last fifteen paragraphs.
But in my opinion the technique of almost every tragedy is
explicable only on the assumption that the regular actors were
restricted to three; and, as I stated at the beginning, it is
physically possible to stage every play with that number. In the
case of a few pieces, however, this limitation imposes practices
which so outrage the modern aesthetic sense that we instinctively
long for some manner of escape. According to late and unreliable
evidence an extra performer was called a <i>parachoregema</i>.
This name would indicate that he was an extra expense to the
man who financed each poet’s plays (the choregus, see <a href="#Page_186">pp. 186</a>
and <a href="#Page_270">270 f.</a>, below), and consequently that his employment would
be determined by the wealth or liberality of the latter. But
whether it was in fact possible for the tragic playwrights occasionally
to have the services of such an extra, and, if so, under
what conditions and how, are questions which in the present
state of our knowledge can receive only hypothetical answers.
It must be recognized, however, that the paucity of actors in the
early days resulted, as we have just seen, in conventions of
staging which perhaps were afterward accepted as part of the
tradition, however unnecessary they may in the meanwhile have
become. The technique of composition also makes it clear in
my opinion that extra performers, if such were in fact engaged,
were not on a par with the other three nor employed freely
throughout the whole play but merely recited or sang a very
few lines at those crises in the dramatic economy which were
occasioned by the limitation in the number of regular actors.</p>

<p>We have now discovered why the dialogue technique of
tragedy was more restricted than that of comedy, but there still
remains a further question. Why was the number of actors in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
tragedy usually or always restricted to three, while four actors
were not uncommon in comedy? So long as the poets did their
own acting, there was no occasion for the state to interfere in the
selection of actors. And this situation would naturally continue
for some time after the plays were presented largely or wholly
by actors alone—the poets would still have the matter in their
charge. In fact there is no reason to suppose that the state
interposed its authority before the establishment of the contest
for tragic actors at the City Dionysia in 449 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> This supposition
affords the best explanation for certain ancient notices.
For example, Aeschylus is said to have used Cleander as his first
actor and afterward to have associated Mynniscus with him, and
Sophocles to have employed Tlepolemus continuously. Whatever
truth or error may lie back of these statements they imply
that in the first half of the fifth century the choice of actors rested
solely with the poets. The same implication is inherent in the
fact that the second and third actors were introduced by Aeschylus
and Sophocles respectively. The poets must have made
these additions upon their own initiative. For the state could
not have shown partiality by providing Sophocles, for example,
with more actors than were furnished the other dramatists in
the same contest; and if they were all alike given an increased
number, there would be no reason for crediting any one of them
with the innovation. The state must have assumed supervision
of the histrionic features of the dramatic contests at the same
time that it established a prize for actors, viz., in 449 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> And
since the tragedies of this period were presented by three actors,
this number became crystallized, and so was never thereafter, so
far as the state was concerned, exceeded in tragedy. Tragedies
were added to the Lenaean program and a prize for tragic actors
established for that festival simultaneously, about 433 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
Naturally the conventional number of tragic actors would be
transferred from the older contest to the newer. In comedy,
however, the development and tradition were entirely different
(see <a href="#Page_52">pp. 52 f.</a>, above). Primitive comedies in Attica were
performed by a double chorus of choreutae, who constituted an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
undifferentiated crowd and assumed no individual rôles, but
sang (or spoke) singly, antiphonally, or in unison. Shortly
before 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> regular actors were introduced in contradistinction
to the choreutae; and Cratinus, imitating contemporaneous
tragedy, set their number at three. Yet the choreutae did not
for a long time entirely give up their old license and self-assertiveness.
Consequently, it is not surprising that the number
of performers did not remain at the tragic norm. The fact that
a contest of comic actors was not established at the Lenaea until
about 442 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (at the City Dionysia not until about 325 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
allowed a slight interval for this reaction to assert itself before
usage became legalized. Such, then, are the reasons for the
number of actors being less restricted in comedy than in tragedy.</p>

<p>For about a century, beginning with 449 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the state
annually engaged three tragic protagonists to be assigned by lot
to the three poets who were about to compete with plays. Each
protagonist seems to have hired his own subordinate actors
(deuteragonist and tritagonist) and with their assistance presented
all the plays (at the City Dionysia three tragedies and one
satyric drama) which his poet had composed for the occasion.
The victorious actor in each year’s contest was automatically
entitled to appear the following year. The other two protagonists
were perhaps selected by means of a preliminary contest,
such as is mentioned for comic actors on the last day of the
Anthesteria. These regulations applied, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, also
to the contest of comic actors and to the tragic and comic contests
at the Lenaea. Thus at the Lenaea of 418 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Callippides
acted in the two tragedies of Callistratus, and Lysicrates in the
other dramatist’s two plays. And it should be noted that,
whereas Callippides won the prize for acting, Callistratus was
defeated in the competition of tragedies. This must have been
a point of considerable difficulty, for an actor’s chances must have
been greatly hampered by his being required to present a poor
series of plays; and a poet, likewise, must have suffered by reason
of an inferior presentation of his dramas. But sometime in the
fourth century, when the playwrights were no longer required<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
to write satyr-plays (see <a href="#Page_199">p. 199</a>, below), a more equitable system
was introduced. Each of the protagonists in turn now acted one
of the three tragedies of each poet, the histrionic talent at the
disposal of each dramatist being thus made exactly the same.
For example, at the City Dionysia of 341 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (<a href="#figure76a">Fig. 76</a>) Astydamas
was the victorious playwright; his <i>Achilles</i> was played
by Thettalus, his <i>Athamas</i> by Neoptolemus, and his <i>Antigone</i> by
Athenodorus. The same actors likewise presented the three
tragedies of Evaretus and those of the third dramatist. On this
occasion Neoptolemus won; a year later, under similar conditions,
he was defeated by Thettalus.</p>

<p>We have seen how slow was the rise of actors into a profession
distinct from the poets. At a later time, however, they were
strongly organized into guilds under the name of “Dionysiac
artists” (οἱ ἀμφὶ τὸν Διόνυσον τεχνῖται). Their strongest “union”
(κοινόν or σύνοδος) was centered at Athens and it was also the
earliest (fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Others were situated at Thebes,
Argos, Teos, Ptolemais, Cyprus, and in all parts of the Greek-speaking
world. Now already in the fifth century traveling
troupes had presented at the country festivals plays which had
won popular acclaim in Athens. For economic reasons it was
to the advantage both of the players who had to divide their
emoluments and of the communities which hired them to make
these traveling companies as small as possible and consequently
to restrict their repertoire to plays capable of being performed by
a minimum of actors. With the organization of guilds the
presentation of dramas “in the provinces” or even at important
festivals would be taken over by them; and the same economic
causes as before would operate to restrict the number of players
in a company. There is reason to believe that a normal troupe
in the time of the <i>technitae</i> consisted of three actors.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Inscriptions
for the Soteric festival at Delphi for the years 272-269 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
inclusive contain the names of ten companies of tragic actors
and twelve of comic actors. These performers belonged to the
Athenian guild and in every case there are three names to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
company. There is no reason to doubt that this number was
customary also in the wandering troupes of the pre-technitae
period. Some maintain that already in the fifth century a fourth
actor was called a parachoregema, as being an extra burden upon
the choregus (cf. <a href="#Page_182">p. 182</a>, above). But Professor Rees has made it
seem very probable that the term took its rise in the time of the
technitae. For in later usage <i>choregein</i> (χορηγεῖν) in most cases
no longer meant “to defray the expense of the chorus,” “to act
as choregus,” but simply “to furnish” without any reference to
the choregic system at all. Parachoregema, therefore, would
signify “that which is furnished in supplement,” “an extra.”
In other words, if the officials of a city contracted with the union
for one or more troupes for a dramatic festival they would be
provided with three-actor companies; but if they desired to
witness some four-actor play or to avoid the infelicities arising
from the splitting or ill-assorted doubling of rôles (see <a href="#Page_191">pp. 191 f.</a>,
below) they might <i>at extra expense</i> secure a parachoregema in
the form of a fourth actor and so gratify their wishes. According
to either interpretation, therefore, the term may refer, <i>inter alia</i>,
to a fourth actor, but there is a wide difference as to the theory of
the circumstances and situation which produced this meaning.</p>

<p>Since our extant plays belong exclusively to the fifth and
fourth centuries, the size of the troupes furnished by the guilds
could have exerted no influence upon them. But it is quite
possible that the dramatists of later times deliberately adapted
their technique to the needs of subsequent presentation by such
companies. For example, the number of characters who can
have a speaking part in a dialogue naturally cannot exceed the
number of actors at the poet’s disposal. Whatever may have
been the situation previously, in the technitae period this would
be three. Therefore if the technitae did not give rise to, they at
least fixed the so-called aesthetic law that if a fourth character is
present at a conversation between three others he must keep
silent. This rule is expressed by Horace<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> in the words: “Let
no fourth character strive to speak,” and it is often mentioned by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
writers of the Alexandrian and Roman periods. The scholiasts
belong to this time and their comments frequently reveal an
attempt to foist the aesthetic law upon the fifth-century dramas.
The difficulty which the fifth-century writers encountered in
mastering even the three-part dialogue (see <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>) lends to
such an attempt a misleading facility. In tragedy the normal
restriction of actors to three makes the task especially easy, but
even here the law is only superficially observed. For the coryphaeus
often participates so freely in a conversation between
actors (see <a href="#Page_164">pp. 164 f.</a> and <a href="#Page_169">169 f.</a>, above) that only by courtesy can
it be called a three-part dialogue. In Seneca’s Roman tragedies,
on the contrary, the coryphaeus never speaks if more than one
actor is present.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Now Professor Rees would trace the aesthetic
law back to fifth-century times, but Dr. Kaffenberger (<i>op. cit.</i>,
pp. 22 f.) rightly demurs. He points out that in Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus
at Colonus</i>, vss. 1099-1555, Oedipus, Antigone, and Ismene are
continuously present but that Ismene says never a word. What
is the cause of this silence? During vss. 1099-1210 and vss.
1500-1555 Theseus is also present and during vss. 1249-1446
Polynices is present. In these scenes, therefore, it is possible to
explain Ismene’s silence on the basis of the aesthetic law. But
during vss. 1447-99 Oedipus and his two daughters are left alone,
and Ismene still remains silent. Consequently the aesthetic
explanation breaks down at this point and we must stand by our
earlier conclusion (see <a href="#Page_181">pp. 181 f.</a>, above) that throughout these
scenes Ismene is impersonated by a mute. Moreover, since
Oedipus forbids his daughters sharing his final moments with
him, why does the poet not let him take leave of them on the
stage instead of resorting to a messenger’s narrative (cf. vss.
1611 ff.)? The answer is obvious. In such a situation Ismene
simply <i>must</i> have spoken and this a mute could not have done for
her. Moreover, there is no aesthetic reason why the law should
not be as binding in comedy as in tragedy. Nevertheless, fifth-century
comedies indisputably violated it and possibly fourth-century
comedies did also (see <a href="#Page_171">pp. 171-73</a>, above). Therefore, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
tragedy was more scrupulous it must have been because its
actors were less numerous. But in truth it was not until the
period of the technitae and their three-actor troupes that a hard-and-fast
rule was established. Notwithstanding, the grammarians
as a result of their closet study of Attic drama seized
upon the observance of the law in fifth-century tragedy and
usually in New Comedy, which was greatly influenced by
Euripides, as a justification for tracing the practice back to an
earlier origin. Except in one scene Seneca always observed the
law.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> But when Plautus and Terence attempted to transplant
New Comedy to Italian soil, they encountered a difficulty. It
was the use of masks which enabled the Greek playwrights to
shift their actors from one rôle to another with lightning speed.
But masks are said not to have been employed on the Roman
stage until the next century. Therefore, even if the Greek
comedies had been translated without modification it would
have been quite impossible to present them at Rome with only
three or four (maskless) actors. Accordingly, Plautus and
Terence seem to have employed five or six performers and
occasionally even more, and then proceeded to make further use
of them so as to gratify the Roman desire for spectacular effects.
By combining Greek plays into one Latin version (by “contaminating”
them, to use the technical term) and by altering
them freely they produced many scenes in which four or five
persons participate in the same dialogue.</p>

<p>The fact that women’s parts in Elizabethan drama were
played by boys has been used to explain the fondness of Elizabethan
heroines for masquerading in masculine attire. Now the
Greek theater, likewise, knew no actresses—all parts, regardless
of sex, were presented by men. Can any effect of this practice
be traced in the extant plays? In the first place Greek drama
also was not unacquainted with the spectacle of masculine performers
impersonating women who were disguised as men; cf.
the rôle of Mnesilochus in Aristophanes’ <i>Women at the Thesmophoria</i>,
and the chorus and several characters in the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
author’s <i>Women in Council</i>. But in the Greek theater this
occurrence was too rare to be significant. Secondly, it has
frequently been observed that the heroines of Greek tragedy are
as a rule lacking in feminine tenderness and diffidence and are
prone to such masculine traits as boldness, initiative, and self-reliance.
On the other hand the women who have speaking
parts in comedy are usually either impaired in reputation or
disagreeable in character—courtesans, ravished maidens, shrews,
scolds, jealous wives, intriguing mothers-in-law, etc.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Now these
facts are doubtless the resultant of many factors. For example,
tragedy has little direct use for the modest violet type of woman,
and the sharp demarcation between dramatic genres (see <a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>,
below) tended to prevent their indirect employment in scenes
meant merely to relieve the tragic intensity of the main plot.
Likewise, social conditions must have had a great deal to do with
the exclusion of women of unblemished reputation and attractive
years from the comic stage (see <a href="#Page_277">pp. 277-79</a>, below). Nevertheless
when all is said I consider it quite possible that the representation
of women by men actors was partially responsible for such a
choice and for the delineation of female rôles. At least male
performers must have found such types of women much easier
to impersonate. Finally, if children were represented only in pantomime
and their words spoken by a grown actor from behind the
scenes (see <a href="#Page_179">pp. 179 f.</a>, above) we can understand why girls never
have a speaking part and one reason why the words put in boys’
mouths are often too old for them. A competent critic has
declared: “Euripides’ children do not sing what is appropriate to
children in the circumstances supposed but what the poet felt for
the children and for the situations. In particular the song of the
boy over the dead body of his mother in the <i>Alcestis</i> is one of his
grossest errors in delineation.”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> This situation, also, is capable of
several explanations, but who will deny that the practice of
having children’s parts declaimed by adults belongs among them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>In France the court compelled actors to furnish amusement
and the church damned them for complying. In Rome the
actors were slaves or freedmen and belonged to the dregs of
society. Only in Greece did no stigma rest upon the histrionic
profession. As we have seen (<a href="#Page_131">pp. 131 f.</a>, above) the actors were
active participants in a religious service and during the festival
performances their persons were quasi-sacrosanct. As such, they
were entitled to and received the highest respect, and their
occupation was considered an honorable one. Consequently,
they were often the confidants and associates of royalty and
wielded no mean influence in the politics of their native lands.
In particular as they traveled from court to court they often
acted as intermediaries in diplomatic negotiations. Thus
Aeschines, an ex-actor, was almost as influential in the Athenian
faction which favored the Macedonians as was Demosthenes in
that which opposed them. And though the latter in his speeches
indulged in frequent sneers at Aeschines’ theatrical career, this
was not on account of his profession per se but because Demosthenes
claimed he had been a failure at it. Aeschines and Aristodemus,
another actor, twice went as ambassadors from Athens
to Philip, king of Macedonia, with whom the latter was <i>persona
gratissima</i>. Thettalus was an especial favorite of Alexander the
Great, who sent him as an emissary to arrange his marriage with
a Carian satrap’s daughter. When Thettalus was defeated by
Athenodorus at Tyre in 332 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Alexander said that he would
rather have lost a part of his kingdom than to have seen Thettalus
defeated. These men were contemporaries of Aristotle, who
declared in his <i>Rhetoric</i> that in his day actors counted for more
in the dramatic contests than the poets.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The huge fees that
they received are often mentioned. In view of all this it is not
surprising that they arrogated to themselves many liberties.
Aristotle states that Theodorus always insisted upon being the
first actor to appear in a play, doubtless on a principle analagous
to that which Mr. William Archer<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> mentions: “Where it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
desired to give to one character a special prominence and predominance,
it ought, if possible, to be the first figure on which
the eye of the audience falls.... The solitary entrance of
Richard III throws his figure into a relief which could by no
other means have been attained.” This anecdote may mean
merely that Theodorus assumed the rôle of the first character,
however insignificant, in order to appear first upon the scene.
But some have thought that he actually had the plays modified
so that the character which he was to enact might appear first.
Even upon the first hypothesis, however, slight alterations might
sometimes have been necessary. For example, if he wished to
impersonate Antigone in such a play as Euripides’ <i>Phoenician
Maids</i> and if no passage were provided like vss. 88-102 to enable
the actor to shift from Jocaste, who opens the tragedy, to Antigone
(see <a href="#Page_177">pp. 177 f.</a>, above), then perhaps the simplest solution
would have been to interpolate a few such lines for this purpose.
But however this may have been in Theodorus’ case there can
be little doubt that the actors did sometimes take such liberties
with their dramatic vehicles. To correct this abuse Lycurgus,
who was finance minister of Athens in the last third of the fourth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and “completed” the theater (see <a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>, above), is
said to have had state copies of old plays provided from which
the actors were not allowed to deviate; and Lycon was fined ten
talents, which Alexander paid, for having interpolated one line
in a comedy.</p>

<p>Naturally most actors were peculiarly adapted to certain
types of characters. Thus Nicostratus was most successful as a
messenger, Theodorus in female rôles, etc. The interesting
significance of the parts borne by Apollogenes, an actor of the
third century, has only recently been recognized. At Argos he
impersonated Heracles and Alexander, at Delphi, Heracles and
Antaeus, at Dodona, Achilles, etc., in addition to winning a
victory in boxing at Alexandria. Evidently this actor was a
pugilist for whom rôles and plays were carefully chosen which
would display his physique and strength to the best advantage.
Now these special predilections and accomplishments of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
actors, as well as their physical qualities, must often have run
afoul of the constant doubling and the occasional splitting of
rôles as required by the restricted number of players. Professor
Rees makes good use of such points in arguing against the three-actor
limitation in fifth-century tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> But in such matters
custom is all-important; we cannot be sure to what extent the
Greeks were offended by infelicities of this nature. In my
opinion such considerations are not strong enough to break down
the arguments drawn from dramatic technique (see <a href="#Page_173">pp. 173-82</a>,
above).</p>

<p>I ought not to conclude this chapter without a few words
concerning the manner in which act divisions arose from the
alternation of choral odes and histrionic passages in ancient
drama. The earliest tragedies, such as Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i>
and <i>Persians</i>, began with the entrance song of the chorus, which
is called the <i>parodus</i>. In later plays it was customary for one
or more actors to appear before the choral parodus in a so-called
<i>prologue</i>. The first instance of this which is known to us
occurred in Phrynichus’ <i>Phoenician Women</i> (476 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). After
the parodus came an alternation of histrionic scenes (<i>episodes</i>)
and choral odes (<i>stasima</i>), concluding with a histrionic <i>exodus</i>.
These are nontechnical definitions and do not cover every variation
from type, but they will suffice for present purposes. Thus
Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus Bound</i> falls into the following divisions:
prologue, vss. 1-127; parodus, vss. 128-92; first episode, vss.
193-396; first stasimon, vss. 397-435; second episode, vss. 436-525;
second stasimon, vss. 526-60; third episode, vss. 561-886;
third stasimon, vss. 887-906; exodus, vss. 907-1093.
Though the number of stasima (and of episodes) was more
usually three, as in this case, there was originally no hard-and-fast
rule on the subject. In several plays there were four stasima
and four episodes, and in Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i> five of each.
Therefore in a normal tragedy like the <i>Prometheus</i> the number of
histrionic divisions would be five—prologue, three episodes, and
exodus. In the early plays which had no prologue the histrionic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
divisions fell to four—three episodes and an exodus. In several
of the later plays, on the other hand, they rose to six, and in the
<i>Antigone</i> to seven. As the lack of connection between chorus
and plot increased and the size and importance of choral odes
diminished (see <a href="#Page_126">pp. 126 f.</a>, <a href="#Page_136">136-49</a>, and <a href="#Page_168">168</a>, above) there was the
more excuse for ignoring the choral elements and for concentrating
attention upon the histrionic divisions. The development
of comedy led to similar results. The composition of an
Old Comedy has already been discussed (see <a href="#Page_40">pp. 40 f.</a>, above).
So long as the agon and the parabasis persisted, the structural
differences between tragedy and comedy were unmistakable;
but with the disappearance of these features early in the fourth
century (see <a href="#Page_42">pp. 42 f.</a>, above) the assimilation of the two genres
rapidly proceeded. Moreover, as the activity of the comic
chorus was confined to <i>entr’actes</i> and as their entertainment
became so foreign to the plot as no longer to be written in the
manuscripts but merely to be indicated by ΧΟΡΟΥ (see <a href="#Page_147">pp. 147 f.</a>),
this tendency to ignore the choral element in favor of the histrionic
became pronounced. Now the number of histrionic
divisions in Old Comedy and in New Comedy was limited to
five even less frequently than in tragedy. And in either literary
genre there was no more reason for such a restriction, whether on
historical or technical grounds, than there would be in modern
drama. In every period such a detail depends, or ought to be
left to depend, entirely upon the requirements of the story
chosen for dramatic presentation. Nevertheless, since the histrionic
divisions in tragedy were more usually five and since
comedy fell more and more under the domination of tragedy,
the rigid principle was at last set up for both tragedy and comedy
that each play should contain five acts, no more, no less; cf.
Horace’s pronunciamento: “Let a play neither fall short of nor
extend beyond a fifth act.”</p>

<p>It should be observed, however, that our English word “act”
conveys a misleading impression in this connection. The Greek
word was simply “part” (μέρος) and denoted merely a division
of the play as determined by choral <i>divertissement</i>, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
written or interpolated. These “parts,” therefore, depended
upon the more or less accidental and haphazard activity of the
chorus and often two or three of them would be required to make
up an act in the modern sense. In other words the modern
notion of an act as an integral part of the story, marking a
definite stage in the unfolding of the plot, was for the most part
yet to be developed, especially in comedy.</p>

<p>The leveling effect of the five-act rule is seen in the modern
editions of Plautus and Terence. It is certain that neither four
nor any other fixed number of pauses was employed at the
premier performances of these dramatists’ works. In some cases
they seem to have been given continuous representation with
neither choral intermezzi nor pauses at the points where the
Greek originals had had <i>entr’actes</i>. From this, however, we
must not infer that Plautus and Terence did not know where the
acts or the “parts” began and closed. If for no other reason, the
recurrence of ΧΟΡΟΥ in at least most of the Greek comedies
which they were translating and adapting would not have
permitted them to be ignorant on this point, for in my opinion,
so far as pauses were inserted in the Roman performances, they
coincided with the corresponding points of division in the Greek
plays. But by this I do not mean that the Latin divisions were
always as numerous as the Greek; in my judgment, owing to
contamination and other modifying influences they were uniformly
fewer. Moreover, when these comedies were first
published for the use of a reading public, it seems that the
manuscripts contained no indication of act divisions. Within
a century of Terence’s death, however, partisans of the five-act
dogma were already attempting to force their Procrustean theory
upon his works. A later effort of this sort is preserved to us in
the commentary of Donatus (fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) and passed
into the printed editions, with some modifications, about
1496 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> Likewise, the Renaissance scholars, obsessed by the
tradition of what had come to be considered an inviolable law,
proceeded to divide each of Plautus’ twenty plays into five acts;
cf. Pius’ edition of 1500 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> The divisions in both poets rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
upon no adequate authority and are easily shown to be incorrect.
Yet, unfortunately, it is now impossible to re-establish the acts
as known to their Latin authors. If we revert to the Greek
terminology, however, somewhat more definite results may be
obtained, though, even so, agreement is not possible in every
case. Technical criteria now at our disposal would indicate
that the original “parts” (μέρη) in these comedies ranged from
a minimum of two or three to a maximum of seven or eight.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INFLUENCE OF FESTIVAL ARRANGEMENTS<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></span></h2>

</div>

<p>We have already seen that the performance of plays at
Athens was confined to two festivals of Dionysus, and the time
when the various dramatic genres began to be presented at each
has been stated (see <a href="#Page_119">pp. 119 f.</a>, above). Since the Lenaea came
at the end of January (Gamelion), when navigation was not yet
considered entirely safe, few strangers were present; and in
consequence this festival became more private and intimate,
more like a family gathering of the Athenians by themselves.
On the contrary the City Dionysia took place toward the end
of March (Elaphebolion), when the allies were accustomed to
send their tribute to Athens and the city was crowded with
visitors from all parts of the Greek world. As a result this
occasion was more cosmopolitan than the other, and every effort
was expended to make it as splendid as possible. All this
explains an episode in the life of Aristophanes. At the City
Dionysia of the year 426 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> was produced his <i>Babylonians</i>, in
which he represented the Athenian state as a mill where the allies
suffered from the tyrannous exactions of Cleon, its manager.
Cleon accordingly lodged with the senate an information
(εἰσαγγελία) charging lèse majesté, aggravated by being committed
in the presence of strangers (παρόντων τῶν ξένων). Therefore,
in his next play, the <i>Acharnians</i>, produced at the Lenaea
of 425 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Aristophanes prefaced some frank expressions of
opinion with the following statement: “And what I shall say
will be dreadful but just, for Cleon will not be able <i>now</i> to malign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
me for defaming the state to alien ears. For we are alone; this
is the Lenaea, and the aliens are not yet here, nor the tribute from
the federated states, nor our allies; but we are alone <i>now</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
Similarly, Demosthenes tried to make Midias’ assault upon him
at the City Dionysia of 350 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> seem more heinous by pointing
out that it was committed “in the presence of many, <i>both strangers</i>
and citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Since we have no exact information as to when the City
Dionysia began or ended, we are in doubt as to its duration.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
But it is probable that it lasted for six days, certainly five. The
first day was occupied with the procession, as already described
(see <a href="#Page_121">pp. 121 f.</a>, above). The second day, and possibly the third,
was devoted to dithyrambs, the literary type from which tragedy
had sprung. There were five choruses of boys and five of men,
each of the ten tribes annually standing sponsor for one chorus.
We happen to know that the contest of men was added to this
festival in 508 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Inasmuch as each chorus consisted of fifty
amateur performers, it will be seen that no inconsiderable portion
of the free population received every year a musical training
which could not but enhance their appreciation of the choral and
lyrical parts of the dramas and likewise improve the quality of the
material from which the dramatic choruses were chosen.</p>

<p>The last three days of the festival seem to have been given
over to the dramatic performances, but just what the arrangements
were is not known. In Aristophanes’ <i>Birds</i>, vss. 786 ff.,
the chorus, praising the use of wings, remarks that “if one of you
spectators were so provided and became wearied with the tragic
choruses, he might fly away home and dine and then fly back
again to us.” From this passage it has been plausibly concluded
that the comedies came later in the day than the tragedies. It
would seem as if the three tragic playwrights must have produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
their plays on as many successive mornings, the comedies following
later each day in similar rotation.</p>

<p>It is well known that at the City Dionysia each of three
tragic poets brought out four plays in a series, three tragedies
and one satyric drama (see <a href="#Page_23">pp. 23 f.</a>, above). Such a group was
termed a <i>didascalia</i> (“teaching”). It was Aeschylus’ frequent
practice to have all four plays treat different aspects of the same
general theme, the levity of the concluding piece counterbalancing
somewhat the seriousness of the three tragedies. In that
case the set of four was called a tetralogy; but if the satyric
drama dealt with a different topic than the tragedies, the latter
were said to form a trilogy. No tetralogy or didascalia is extant
and only one trilogy, the <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Libation-Bearers</i>, and
<i>Eumenides</i>, which Aeschylus brought out in 458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The satyric
drama in this series is not preserved but was entitled <i>Proteus</i>.
It may have dealt with the shipwreck of Menelaus, Agamemnon’s
brother, on his return from Troy. After Aeschylus the four
pieces in a didascalia were usually unrelated in subject.</p>

<p>According to canonical doctrine satyric drama was the intermediate
stage in the development of tragedy from the dithyramb
and was retained in the festival program as a survival. Within
recent years, as this hypothesis has been subjected to searching
criticism, its supports have slowly crumbled away. My own
opinion is that tragedy and the satyr-play are independent
offshoots of the dithyramb (see <a href="#Page_1">pp. 1-35</a>, above). In either case,
since the dramatic performances were part of a Bacchic festival
and since the Bacchic element had long since been discarded by
tragedy (see <a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>, above), it is no doubt true that the satyric
drama was in the program partly in order to keep up the religious
associations, as revealing its connection with Dionysus more
plainly than did mature tragedy. Nevertheless the same
tendencies which had broken down the exclusively Dionysiac
themes in tragedy were at work here also and would not be
denied. We have already seen (see <a href="#Page_126">pp. 126 f.</a>, above) how the
writers of satyr-plays arbitrarily superimposed Silenus and a
chorus of satyrs upon some non-Dionysiac subject. Both in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i> and in Sophocles’ <i>Trackers</i>, the sole extant
representatives of the genre, the Bacchic element is restricted to
these followers of his, and Dionysus himself figures only as he is
apostrophized or mentioned by them. In 438 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Euripides
introduced a further innovation by bringing out the <i>Alcestis</i> as
the last play in his didascalia. Neither Silenus nor the chorus of
satyrs appears in this piece, the theme being entirely non-Dionysiac;
but the drunkenness of Heracles and the brutal
frankness in the quarrel between Admetus and his father suggest
the spirit of the old satyric drama, while the happy ending and
the humor remind us of a comedy. These incongruities and the
exceptionable circumstances under which the play was produced
have occasioned the controversy, which began in antiquity and
still continues, as to how the <i>Alcestis</i> is to be classified as a
literary type. Is it a tragedy, comedy, satyr-play, tragi-comedy,
melodrama, <i>Schauspiel</i>, <i>Tendenz-Schrift</i>, or what?<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> How far
Euripides’ innovation in substituting such a play for the usual
satyric drama may have met with the approval and emulation
of his fellow-playwrights we have no means of knowing; but
an extant inscription of a century later shows that the satyr-play
had then been degraded still further (<a href="#figure76a">Fig. 76</a>). At the City
Dionysia of 341, 340, and 339 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the poets were no longer
compelled each to conclude his group of pieces in the old way,
but a single satyric drama was performed, before the tragedies
began at all, as ample recognition of the Dionysiac element which
had once been all-pervasive in the festivals.</p>

<p>During the latter part of its history five comic poets competed
each year at the City Dionysia, and each presented but a single
play; there is some reason for believing that the number was five
also at the beginning, but possibly there were then only three
competitors. At any rate there were certainly not more than
three for a while during the Peloponnesian War (431-404 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
When the comedies were restricted to three they were naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
performed one on each of the last three days, after that day’s
tragedies and satyr-play, as we have just seen. But what the
arrangement was when the larger number was presented is not
so obvious. Was a second comedy crowded into the program
on two of the days? Or were comedies produced also on the
second and third days of the festival, after the dithyrambic
choruses? The latter alternative would be my choice, and this
would explain why in the inscriptional records the comedies
preceded the tragedies, though in the chronological sequence of
the last three days they followed them. When Aristophanes
brought out his <i>Women in Council</i> he was so unfortunate in the
drawing of lots as to be forced to perform his play first in the
series of comedies. Therefore he had his chorus say (vss.
1158 ff.):</p>

<p>This close juxtaposition of tragedy and comedy at the same
festival must have strengthened a practice which in any case
would have been inevitable, viz., that the comic poets should
parody lines, scenes, or even whole plots of their tragic confrères.
In a community as small as Athens it was impossible that advance
knowledge of a tragic plot or even the exact wording of striking
lines should not sometimes reach the ears of a comic playwright
and be turned to skilful account by him. Even when the secret
had been guarded until the very moment of presentation, it must
have been feasible for a comedian whose play was to be produced
on a subsequent day of the festival to incorporate a few lines or a
short scene in his comedy overnight. But this is mere theorizing,
for I remember no passage where such “scoops” are mentioned.
The parodying of tragedies brought out at previous festivals,
however, was exceedingly common. The extant plays preserve
some instances of this, and the scholiasts tell us of many others.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
Parodies of no less than thirty-three of Euripides’ tragedies are
preserved in the remains of Aristophanes’ comedies. But the
situation is too well known to merit further amplification here,
cf. Murray, <i>op. cit.</i>, <i>passim</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, though tragedy, comedy, and satyric
dramas were juxtaposed at the festivals, they were not intermingled.
The lines of demarcation were kept distinct. With
very rare exceptions, like the <i>Alcestis</i>, the audience always knew
what kind of a play it was about to hear, and (what was even
more important) the poet always knew what kind of a play he
was supposed to write. Of course, this is not the same as saying
that all Greek tragedies were alike or that all Greek comedies
seemed to be poured from the same mold. Within the type there
was room for the greatest diversity, but the types did not overlap
or borrow much from one another. This practice was a natural
outgrowth of the Greek love for schematizing which displayed
itself in the formulation and observance of rigid laws in every
branch of art and especially in literature; in the field of drama
this tendency was strengthened by the festival arrangements.
Contrast with this the modern confusion of all the arts and
all the literary genres which, in the sphere of drama, results
in plays harder to classify than Polonius’ “tragical-comical-historical-pastorals.”
This is one of the things that Voltaire had
in mind when he declared that Shakespeare wrote like “a drunken
savage.”</p>

<p>The simplicity of the Greek effect is aptly characterized by
Mr. Clayton Hamilton:<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> “Although the ancient drama frequently
violated the three unities of action, time, and place, it
always preserved a fourth unity, which we may call unity of
mood.” Possibly regard for this fourth unity caused Euripides
to employ the <i>deus ex machina</i> at the conclusion of his <i>Iphigenia
among the Taurians</i>. It is well known that this is the play that
lends least support to the frequent charge that Euripides used
the <i>deus</i> to cut the inextricable tangle of his plots. Here the
final, insurmountable difficulty is of the poet’s own choosing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Orestes and his party have at last got their vessel free of the shore,
and all the playwright needed to do was to allow them to sail on
in safety and thus bring his play to a close. But arbitrarily he
causes a contrary wind and sea to drive their ship back to land,
making divine intervention indispensable. Of course this device
enabled him to overleap the unity of time and bring events far in
the future within the limits of his dramatic day, and frequently
that was all that Euripides had in mind in having recourse to
this artifice (see <a href="#Page_295">p. 295</a>, below). But in the present instance I
think he had an additional motive, one which has a place in
this discussion. The gist of the matter is well expressed by
Mr. Prickard:<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> “If the fugitives had simply escaped, snapping
their fingers at Thoas, the ending would have been essentially
comic: perhaps, after the grave and pathetic scenes which have
gone before, we should rather call it burlesque. But the appearance
of the <i>deus ex machina</i>, a device not itself to be praised,
enables the piece to be finished after all with dignity and elevation
of feeling.”</p>

<p>In connection with the foregoing arises another point: when
the line between tragedy and comedy was drawn so sharply, we
should hardly expect to find the writer of tragedies and the writer
of comedies united in one and the same person. As a matter of
fact not a single case is known in all Greek drama. “The sock
and buskin were not worn by the same poet”;<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> the Greek theater
knew no Shakespeare. This very versatility of the Elizabethan
poet helps to explain why his tragedies contain much that is
humorous and his comedies much that is painful, a characteristic
which has been so offensive to his French critics. Very similar
is the situation among the actors. At the City Dionysia, beginning
with 449 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, a prize was awarded to the best actor in the
tragedies brought out each year, and about 325 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> a contest
was established for comic actors. At the Lenaea, prizes were
offered for comic and for tragic actors from about 442 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and
about 433 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, respectively. These arrangements would tend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
still further to keep each actor within his specialty. No performer
in both tragic and comic rôles is indubitably known until
Praxiteles, who performed at Delphi in 106 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> as a comedian
and nine years later as a tragedian. Two other instances
occurred a little later. In the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Thymoteles
seems to have been both a tragic poet and a comic actor. These
examples exhaust the list in pre-Christian times.</p>

<p>In the preceding discussion some changes in the festival
program have already been mentioned, for the program was not,
like Athena, fully grown at birth. For example, the requirement
that each tragic poet should present three tragedies and a satyric
drama in a group did not go back to the introduction of tragedy
by Thespis in 534 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and cannot be established for any poet
before Aeschylus. It is likely that this regulation, together with
the main outlines of the program as known at a later period,
dates from about 501 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when the festival seems to have been
reorganized (see <a href="#Page_319">p. 319</a>, below). This is the period with which
the official records began, when also the κῶμοι, that is, the volunteer
performances from which formal comedy was derived,
were first added to the festival. In addition to the changes that
have already been noticed we may now mention the following:
It was not customary for plays to be performed more than once at
Athens. It is true that the more successful plays in the city might
be repeated at the Rural Dionysia, which were held in the various
demes (townships) during the month Posideon (December),
and that some of these provincial festivals, notably that at the
Piraeus, were almost as splendid as those at Athens itself; yet
the fact remains that at Athens the repetition of a play was an
exceptional thing. Thus, when Aeschylus died in 456 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, honor
was shown him by the provision that his plays might be brought
out in rivalry with the new productions of living tragedians, and
they are said to have won the prize in this way several times.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
This explains what Aeschylus is represented as saying in Aristophanes’
<i>Frogs</i> (vss. 866 ff.), where he protests against contending
with Euripides “here in Hades” on the ground that they will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
not be on equal terms, “for his poetry,” he says, “died with him
[and came down to Hades], so that he will be able to recite it,
but mine did not die with me.” There is here not only the
obvious meaning that Aeschylus thought his poems had achieved
an immortality which Euripides’ never could, but also an allusion
to the special privileges bestowed upon them. Again, the
Athenians conceived such an admiration for the parabasis of
Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i>, doubtless on account of the sensible and
patriotic advice therein given the citizens to compose their
differences, that the play was given a second time by request.
As a result of such precedents, in 386 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the repetition of one
old tragedy was given a regular place in the program, as a
separate feature, however, no longer in rivalry with new works;
and in 339 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> this arrangement was extended also to old
comedies. It must further be remembered that the program
was susceptible of considerable modification from year to year.
When a single satyr-play was brought out as a substitute for one
in each poet’s group (see <a href="#Page_199">p. 199</a>, above), naturally each playwright
presented three tragedies and nothing more, and this
actually happened in 341 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> But in the following year each of
the three poets produced but two tragedies. The program was
therefore flexible enough to meet special needs or emergencies.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the discussion of the festival program
up to this point applies as a whole to the City Dionysia
alone and only in part to the Lenaea. For example, at the
Lenaea there were no dithyrambic contests, and there is no
evidence for the presentation of old plays or even of satyric
dramas. Our most tangible information is an inscription for
the years 419 and 418 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (see <a href="#Page_184">p. 184</a>, above). On these occasions
there were two poets and each brought out two tragedies.</p>

<p>Possibly the first thing, apart from physical conditions,
which would strike the modern theatergoer’s attention after
entering an ancient Greek theater would be the fact that he was
provided with no playbill. For this lack he received compensation
in three ways: The first was the <i>proagon</i> (προαγών; πρό
“before” + ἀγών “contest”), i.e., the ceremony before the contest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
This was held in the nearby Odeum on the eighth day of the
month Elaphebolion (end of March), which was probably the
second day before the City Dionysia proper began. In this
function the poets, the actors (without their masks and stage
costumes), the choregi (see <a href="#Page_270">pp. 270 f.</a>, below), and the choruses
participated. As the herald made announcement each poet and
choregus with their actors and chorus presented themselves for
public inspection. It was therefore possible for anyone interested,
simply by being present on this occasion, to learn what
poets were competing, the names of their actors and plays, the
order of their appearance, and similar details. Moreover, the
mere titles of the plays by themselves would often convey considerable
information to the more cultured members of the audience.
Thus, names like Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i>, Sophocles’
<i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, and Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i> or <i>Iphigenia
among the Taurians</i> indicate the locale and general theme of the
play on their face, and to the more cultivated spectators titles
such as Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus the King</i> or Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i> would
be equally significant. On the other hand, such names as Euripides’
<i>Suppliants</i> or <i>Phoenician Maids</i> would be either mystifying
or misleading, especially if the hearer was well enough versed
in Greek drama to remember that Aeschylus and Phrynichus,
respectively, had applied these titles to plays which actually
dealt with entirely different incidents.</p>

<p>The proagon furnished the name and scene for one of Aristophanes’
(or Philonides’) comedies, but unfortunately we have
no inkling as to how the theme was treated. In 406 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the
news of Euripides’ death came from Macedonia just before
this ceremony. Sophocles appeared in garments indicative of
mourning and had his chorus leave off their accustomed crowns.
The spectators are said to have burst into tears. In Plato’s
<i>Symposium</i> (194B) Socrates is represented as referring to the
proagon at the Lenaean festival of the year 416 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> as follows:
“I should be forgetful, O Agathon, of the courage and spirit
which you showed when your compositions were about to be
exhibited, when you mounted the platform with your actors and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
faced so large an audience altogether undismayed, if I thought
you would on the present occasion [a celebration in honor of his
first victory] be disturbed by a small company of friends.”</p>

<p>The second compensation for the absence of a playbill was
provided within the plays themselves. First, with reference to
the imaginary scene of action. The mythological stories which
uniformly supplied the tragic playwrights with their themes were
always definitely localized, and the tragic poets seemed to feel
the necessity of indicating the place of action. This was commonly
done by having an actor refer to “this land of so-and-so,”
or even address it or some conspicuous object. At the beginning
of Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i> the aged servant says to Orestes, “This is
ancient Argos for which you longed” (vs. 4); in the <i>Bacchanals</i>,
Dionysus in a typical Euripidean prologue states, “I come to this
land of the Thebans” (vs. 1); Apollo begins Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i>
with the words, “O house of Admetus!” (vs. 1); and Eteocles
in Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i> addresses the spectators,
“O citizens of Cadmus” (vs. 1). When the scene is changed
within a play each locality is clearly identified. Thus at the
beginning of Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i>, Delphi is indicated as the
scene in the usual way; a little later Apollo bids Orestes “go to
the city of Pallas” (vs. 79), and still later, when the shift is
supposed to have taken place, Orestes enters and says, “O Queen
Athena, I come at the bidding of Loxias” (vs. 235). Euripides
was most punctilious about this matter: he usually identified his
scene within the first five lines and always within the first fifty.
Aeschylus and Sophocles were not always so particular: in the
<i>Antigone</i>, Thebes is not mentioned until vs. 101; and in the
<i>Persians</i>, though it early becomes apparent that the action is
laid in Persia, Susa is not actually shown to be the place of action
before vs. 761. On the other hand, Euripides sometimes plays
a little joke upon his audience; for example, the <i>Andromache</i>
begins, “O pride of Asia, city of Thebe, whence I came to Priam’s
princely halls as Hector’s bride,” as if the scene were laid in
Asia Minor; but in vs. 16 we learn that the scene is really placed
in Phthia!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>In comedy the situation was somewhat different. Except in
mythological parodies the stories are independent of tradition
and newly invented, and usually are very slightly attached to
any definite locality. As a result the plays of Old Comedy are
generally thought of, somewhat vaguely, as taking place in
Athens, though this fact is seldom expressly stated, and we rarely
have any indication as to precisely where in the city the scenic
background is supposed to stand. Occasionally we hear of the
Pnyx (<i>Acharnians</i>, vs. 20) or Chloe’s temple (<i>Lysistrata</i>, vs. 385).
But there is not a word in the <i>Clouds</i> or in the <i>Women at the
Thesmophoria</i> to show where in Athens Socrates’ thinking-shop
or Agathon’s house is situated. A shift of scene is not uncommon.
At the beginning of the <i>Frogs</i>, Dionysus visits his brother
Heracles. Since no other location is specified, this scene is
probably laid in Athens.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> At vs. 182 the orchestra represents
the subterranean lake, and at vs. 436 the chorus informs Dionysus
that he has reached Pluto’s door (see <a href="#Page_88">pp. 88-90</a>, above).</p>

<p>By the time of New Comedy, unless we are definitely informed
to the contrary, the scene is so uniformly laid in Athens that there
was no necessity of saying so. It is true that Athens is mentioned
in Plautus’ <i>The Churl</i>, vss. 1 ff.: “Plautus asks for a tiny part of
your handsome walls where without the help of builders he may
convey Athens,” but it is evident that these words were added
by the Roman poet to the original and so are no exception to the
Greek practice. That the action did customarily take place in
Athens is expressly stated in Plautus’ <i>Menaechmi</i>, vss. 8 ff.:
“And this is the practice of comic poets: they declare that every
thing has been done at Athens, so that their play may seem more
Greek to you.” So thoroughly was this principle ingrained in
the playwrights’ consciousness that they were in danger of a
lapse when they evaded it. Thus Calydon is the imaginary
scene of Plautus’ <i>The Carthaginian</i> (cf. vs. 94); nevertheless at
vs. 372 one character says to another, “If you will but have
patience, my master will give you your freedom and make you
an Attic citizen,” as if they were in Athens! When the poet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
as in this instance, deviated from the usual scene of action, he had
one of the actors, generally the prologus, warn the audience by
saying, “This town is Ephesus” (Plautus’ <i>The Braggart Captain</i>,
vs. 88); “Diphilus wished this city to be named Cyrene” (Plautus’
<i>The Fisherman’s Rope</i>, vs. 32), etc. It is only natural that this
same period should witness the rise of the convention that the
side entrance (parodus) at the spectators’ right led to the harbor
or the market place and that at their left into the country, since
the scene was regularly placed in Athens and since these were the
actual topographical relationships in the Athenian theater (see
<a href="#Page_233">p. 233</a>, below). So firmly was this convention established that in
Plautus’ <i>Amphitruo</i>, Thebes, an inland town, is represented as
having a harbor like Florence, Milan, Rome, etc., in Shakespeare,
or as Bohemia has a seacoast in <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>.</p>

<p>But the plays not only informed the audience where the
scene was laid, but also made known the identity of the dramatic
characters. It is obvious that the first character to appear
would have to state his own name with more or less directness
and then introduce the next character. The latter he might do
(<i>a</i>) by announcing bluntly “Here comes so-and-so,” (<i>b</i>) by
addressing the newcomer by name, (<i>c</i>) by himself inquiring his
name and so eliciting his identity, or (<i>d</i>) by loudly summoning
him out of the house or from a distance. All four of these means
are actually resorted to. Now the earliest Greek plays have no
prologue, but begin with the entrance song of the chorus (the
parodus, see <a href="#Page_192">p. 192</a>, above). Accordingly, in Aeschylus’ <i>Persians</i>
the very first words are intended to reveal the personnel of the
chorus:</p>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Blackie’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At the conclusion of their ode, as Atossa enters they address her

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">thus removing all possibility of doubt as to the identity of the new
arrival. In this connection it ought to be said that introducing
an actor did not necessarily involve a proper name; often it was
enough to indicate the station, occupation, or relationship of the
new character. This rule applies not only to the humbler folk,
such as messengers, herdsmen, nurses, heralds, etc.—in fact
Sophocles usually ignored the entrance of servants, since their
costume showed their position clearly enough—but it sometimes
applies also to those of the highest rank, as in this instance to
Atossa.</p>

<p>Aeschylus’ earlier play, the <i>Suppliants</i>, resembles the <i>Persians</i>
in having no prologue, and so at vs. 12 of the parodus the
choreutae disclose their identity by declaring that Danaus is
their father. Moreover, since Danaus enters the orchestra
simultaneously with the chorus, this statement serves to introduce
him also, though he has no chance to speak until vs. 176.
When he does speak, however, he makes assurance doubly sure
by addressing the chorus as his “children.” Still again, in the
fourth-century <i>Rhesus</i>, which also has no prologue, the chorus
marches in and summons Hector by name from his quarters
(vs. 10).</p>

<p>Thus from the fact that the early plays had no prologues,
there grew up the practice of having the chorus (or coryphaeus)
introduce not merely the first actor but every new character,
as he appeared. For example, when the king of Argos makes his
entrance in the <i>Suppliants</i> he engages in conversation with the
Danaids, ignoring their father, and in reply to their question
declares his name and station (vss. 247 ff.). Originally this
technique was doubtless due in part also to the exigencies of
the one-actor period (see <a href="#Page_165">p. 165</a>, above), and it continued to be
the regular practice, even after prologues were <i>en règle</i>, in all
the plays of Aeschylus and in the earlier ones of Sophocles
and Euripides. In comedy this method of procedure was less
common, partly because this was no longer the usual convention
in contemporaneous tragedy and partly because comedy closely
approximates the manners of everyday life, which do not indorse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
this kind of introduction. When employed in comedy it was
often intended to give a tone of tragic parody. For instance, in
Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i>, vss. 1069 f., the approach of a messenger
is announced by the chorus as follows: “Lo, here speeds
one ‘with bristled crest’ as though to proclaim some message
dire,” the tragic tone of which in the original is unmistakable.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Phrynichus’ <i>Phoenician Women</i> was the first play which
we know to have had a prologue (476 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Aeschylus’ <i>Seven
against Thebes</i> has the earliest extant prologue (467 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Of
course, this change in the economy of the play involved a change
also in dramatic technique. Now the entrance of actors preceded
that of the chorus. If one actor came alone he had to introduce
himself, as Eteocles does in the <i>Seven</i>: “If we succeed, the credit
belongs to heaven; but if we fail, Eteocles alone will loudly be
assailed throughout the town.” If two actors enter together
at the beginning of the play they may by alternately addressing
each other by name make their identity clear to the audience,
as Cratus and Hephaestus do in Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus Bound</i>.
Moreover, before his exit Cratus calls Prometheus, whom he has
helped to nail to the rocky background, by name (vs. 85). We
have seen that when the chorus opened a play they introduced
the actors who followed them. It would be natural that when
the relative position of actors and chorus was interchanged the
technique of introduction should also be reversed; in other words,
that one of the actors in the prologue should now introduce the
on-coming chorus as the latter had previously introduced the
actors. This actually occurs in this play: when the choreutae
appear, the bound Prometheus addresses them as “children of
Tethys and Oceanus,” vss. 136-40. The same artifice recurs in
Aeschylus’ <i>Libation-Bearers</i>, vss. 10-16 (see below). But it is
self-evident that this manner of introducing the chorus would
seldom be satisfactory. In truth, as the chorus gradually but
unmistakably lost its importance, its individuality faded away,
and the need of formally introducing or identifying it almost
disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>The chorus soon lost the exclusive privilege of introducing
actors by <i>addressing</i> them. We have seen that Cratus and
Hephaestus exercise this function for one another, and the former
does the same for Prometheus. But the poets continued much
longer to use the chorus in <i>announcing</i> the approach of a new
character. Dr. Graeber (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 26) claims that Euripides
was the first to employ an actor for this purpose. In his <i>Alcestis</i>
(vss. 24 ff.), Apollo says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo, yonder Death;—I see him nigh at hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Priest of the dead, who comes to hale her down</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But just twenty years before, in Aeschylus’ <i>Libation-Bearers</i>
(vss. 10-17), Orestes announced the approach of the chorus and
Electra as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What see I now? What company of women</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is this that comes in mourning garb attired?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or am I right in guessing that they bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Libations to my father, soothing gifts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To those beneath? It cannot but be so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I think Electra, mine own sister, comes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By wailing grief conspicuous.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Plumptre’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Possibly Graeber did not consider the last instance formulaic
enough to count. But however this may be, at last the actors
largely took over the function of announcing new characters, as
they previously had that of addressing them.</p>

<p>In comedy proper names, and consequently introductions, are
less important. The names of tragedy were largely traditional
and conveyed a meaning to all educated persons in the audience
as soon as they heard them (see <a href="#Page_127">pp. 127 f.</a>, above); but in comedy
a character might almost as well have no name at all as one which
had no associations for the spectators. Accordingly, Aristophanes
and Plautus left many of their characters nameless.
Of course when well-known citizens of Athens, such as Socrates,
Euripides, or Lamachus, were ridiculed, they were definitely
named at their first appearance. When a significant comic name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
was employed it was not mentioned until the audience was in a
position to appreciate the point of the joke, sometimes not until
well along in the play. Thus in Aristophanes’ <i>Birds</i> the names
of Pisthetaerus (Plausible) and Euelpides (Hopeful) are first
mentioned at vss. 644 f.</p>

<p>I conclude this section with three examples of clever introductions.
In Euripides’ <i>Bacchanals</i> (vss. 170 ff.) the blind
Tiresias cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Gate-warder, ho! call Cadmus forth the halls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">... Say to him that Tiresias</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seeks him—he knoweth for what cause I come,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and Cadmus, coming out, replies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dear friend, within mine house I heard thy voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And knew it, the wise utterance of the wise.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The announcement of a new character’s coming was usually a
pretty artificial device, but it is plausibly employed a little
farther on (vss. 210 ff.) in this same play, when Cadmus says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Since thou, Tiresias, seest not this light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will for thee be spokesman of thy words.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo to these halls comes Pentheus hastily.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, at the beginning of Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, Oedipus
inquires: “To what place have we come, Antigone? Who will
receive the wandering Oedipus?” In a blind man these questions
are especially natural, and the use of the proper names
identifies the actors’ rôles. Soon a stranger approaches, and
to him Oedipus repeats his first question (vs. 38). His replies
reveal the location and significance of the scenic setting. The
directness of the play’s first line finds a parallel in Shakespeare’s
<i>Twelfth Night</i>, Act I, scene 2:</p>

</div>

<p>The third compensation for the lack of a playbill was afforded
by the use of masks (see <a href="#Page_221">pp. 221 ff.</a>, below). In Old Comedy
contemporaneous personages were often introduced, and we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
told that their masks were true enough to life for their identity
to be recognizable before the actors had uttered a word. According
to a late anecdote, at the presentation of Aristophanes’
<i>Clouds</i>, Socrates rose from his place and remained standing during
the whole performance so that strangers in attendance might
recognize the original of his double on the stage. In the <i>Knights</i>
(vss. 230 ff.), Aristophanes explains the absence of a portrait-mask
for Cleon on the ground that the mask-makers were too
apprehensive of that demagogue’s vengeance to reproduce his
features. But the playbill value of masks was seen more fully
in the case of more or less conventionalized characters, especially
in New Comedy (Figs. <a href="#figure68">68 f.</a>).<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Pollux, a writer of the second
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, describes twenty-eight such masks for tragedy and
forty-four for New Comedy. The hair, of varying amount,
color, coiffure, and quality, seems to have been the chief criterion,
but dress, complexion, facial features, etc., were also taken into
account. The make-up of every stock character was fixed with
some definiteness and must have been well known to all intelligent
spectators. Thus the first glimpse of approaching actors
enabled an ancient audience to identify the red-headed barbarian
slave, the pale lovelorn youth, the boastful soldier, the voracious
parasite, the scolding wife, the flatterer, the “French” cook, the
maiden betrayed or in distress, the stern father, the designing
courtesan, etc., much more easily than a playbill of the modern
type would have done.</p>

<p>If our modern playgoer in ancient Athens were an American
and so accustomed to staid conduct in a theatrical audience, he
would be surprised at the turmoil of an Athenian performance.
A Frenchman, familiar with the riots which greeted Victor
Hugo’s <i>Hernani</i> or Bernstein’s <i>Après Moi</i>, would be better
prepared for the situation. But in any case he would soon
discover that a prize was to be awarded both in tragedy and in
comedy, and that each poet had his friends, partisans, and claque.
The comic poets at least made no attempt to conceal the fact
that there was a prize and that they were “out” for it. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
almost every play Aristophanes’ choruses advance reasons,
sometimes serious, sometimes fantastic, for favoring their poet
and giving him the victory. A few examples will suffice. In
the <i>Women in Council</i> (vss. 1154 ff.) the chorus says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">Aristophanes was bald-headed, and therefore the chorus humorously

<p class="noindent">The <i>Birds</i> (vss. 1763 ff.) concludes with a sort of “Lo the conquering
hero comes,” an adaptation of Archilochus:</p>

<p class="noindent">where Rogers comments: “These triumphal cries not only
celebrate the triumph of Pisthetaerus [in the play], but also
prognosticate the victory of Aristophanes in the dramatic competition.”

“These Bacchic cries (<i>Evoi, Evae</i>) do not merely celebrate the
success of Praxagora’s revolution, they also prognosticate the
poet’s own success over his theatrical rivals in the Bacchic
contest.” In tragedy we naturally could not expect anything
so frank and undisguised as the first three passages just cited,
but for the last two an adequate parallel is found in the tag
which Euripides employed at the conclusion of his <i>Iphigenia
among the Taurians</i>, <i>Orestes</i>, and <i>Phoenician Maids</i>:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which the ancient scholiast and modern editors rightly interpret
as a prayer for victory in the contest.</p>

<p>But if this were the extent of the influence which the fact of
there being a contest exercised upon Greek drama, the matter
might quickly be dismissed. Actually, however, the system involved
deeper consequences. It is unnecessary here to rehearse
the cumbersome process by which the judges were appointed and
rendered their decision upon dramatic events (see <a href="#Page_272">p. 272</a>, below).
While designed to prevent bribery or intimidation, it had two
other effects as well. One was that, since we have no reason to
believe that the choice of judges was restricted in any way or
that they were not selected from the entire free population, the
judges would therefore represent the average intelligence and
taste, and a poet who cared for victory had to accommodate
himself to this situation and could not make his appeal merely to
the superior attainments of the favored, intellectual class.
Secondly, like most officials at Athens, the judges were liable to
be called to account for their conduct. In fact on the second
day after the conclusion of the City Dionysia a special popular
assembly was held in the theater for the express purpose of airing
complaints concerning the management of the festival; and if
the judges were thought to have been recreant to their duties or
guilty of favoritism, action could be taken against them at that
time while the popular anger was still hot and by the votes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
the very persons whose wishes had been balked. The total
effect of these arrangements was to render the judges extremely
sensitive to the public’s expression of opinion, which was manifested
by whistling, catcalls, applause, knocking the heels
against the seats, etc. Especially in the dithyrambic contests,
where tribal rivalry entered in, feeling sometimes ran very high
and personal encounters were not infrequent. To quell such
riotous disorders it became necessary to appoint certain officials
to maintain order, like sergeants-at-arms. In view of these
conditions, it is not surprising that Plato<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> complains that the
choice of victor had practically been intrusted to a general show
of hands and that the necessity of pleasing the popular taste had
corrupted the very poets themselves. Let us consider just how
this tendency manifested itself.</p>

<p>First of all, then, in the <i>Knights</i>, Aristophanes appeals to the
audience to impress the judges by a hearty burst of applause;
cf. vss. 544 ff.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent38">So seeing our Poet began</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a mood so discreet, nor with vulgar conceit rushed headlong before you at first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Loud surges of praise to his honour upraise; salute him, all hands, with a burst</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent6"><i>Of hearty triumphant Lenaean applause</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That the bard may depart, all radiant and bright</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To the top of his forehead with joy and delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6"><i>Having gained, by your favour, his cause.</i></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Rogers’ translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But some of Aristophanes’ contemporaries stooped far lower than
this. In the <i>Wasps</i> he warns the audience not to expect “two
slaves scattering nuts among the spectators out of a basket”
(vss. 58 f.), animadverting upon a scene in a recent play by
Eupolis. Again, in the <i>Plutus</i> (vss. 789 ff.) one of the characters
refuses an invitation to have titbits distributed and adds: “It
is beneath the dignity of a poet to scatter figs and delicacies to
the spectators, and on these terms to force their laughter.”
In the <i>Peace</i> (vss. 962 ff.) he ridiculed such practices by providing
every spectator with at least one grain of barley! A more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
drastic parody was perpetrated by Hegemon, who brought a
cloakful of stones into the orchestra to be thrown at the spectators!
It is only fair to state that Aristophanes did not lower
himself by using such unprofessional appeals, but the point
which I am urging is confirmed by the practice of his rivals and
by the fact that he sometimes explains his own defeats by his
unwillingness to resort to their methods.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case, tragedy could exhibit no appeals
so undisguised as the above. To judge from Plato’s language,
just cited, in some of the tragedies of his day we might have
found closer parallels to these artifices of the comic playwrights.
Nevertheless, fifth-century tragedy does reveal how the tragic
poets tickled the palates of their auditors. They did this in two
ways: first, they appealed to national pride by rewriting the
mythology in such a way as to assign to Athenian worthies a
part which non-Attic tradition did not recognize; and secondly,
they aroused the chauvinistic spirit by the sentiments, whether
eulogistic of Athens or derogatory to her enemies, which they
placed in their characters’ mouths. These points might be illustrated
at great length; it will suffice to mention a few examples.</p>

<p>According to Attic tradition, Medea sojourned for a while at
Athens. Euripides took advantage of this fact in order to introduce
the Aegeus episode into his <i>Medea</i> and thus bring the Attic
king into connection also with an earlier part of the Colchian’s
career. His character in this play is presented in agreeable
contrast to that of both Medea and Jason, and his chivalry in
offering Athens to Medea as an asylum from her enemies would
bring a thrill of pride to every Attic heart. Furthermore, his
presence served to motivate the famous choral ode (vss. 824 ff.)
beginning:</p>

<p class="noindent">Athens as a place of refuge for suppliants was a favorite note:
the conduct of Demophon in Euripides’ <i>Children of Heracles</i> and
that of Theseus in Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i> and Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus
at Colonus</i> must have given great pleasure to an Athenian
audience.</p>

<p>Still more striking are the sentiments of the dramatic characters.
When Euripides’ <i>Children of Heracles</i> was produced, the
Spartans were accustomed to invade and ravage Attica every
year. To the ancestors of these pillagers Iolaus says in the
play (vss. 309 ff.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">Think what indignation at such ingratitude must have welled up
in every spectator’s heart! Later on in the same play (vss.
1026 ff.) the Argive king, Eurystheus, whom Athens has just
defeated in battle, is made to say:</p>

elders drags in an allusion to “wealthy, splendid Athens,” using
the adjective λιπαραί. Aristophanes said (<i>Acharnians</i>, vs. 640)
that the Athenians could refuse nothing to anyone who applied
this epithet to their city. In Euripides’ <i>Trojan Women</i> the
choreutae are represented as wondering to what part of Greece
the allotment of the spoils will send them, and express the wish
that they “might come to the renowned, heaven-blest land of
Theseus” (vss. 208 f.). There was absolutely no reason why
Trojans should entertain such a partiality toward Athens, and
this undramatic sentiment is frankly directed to the <i>amor patriae</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
of the playwright’s compatriots. In the same poet’s <i>Andromache</i>
the title-character is made to burst out into the following invective
against Sparta (vss. 445 ff.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O ye in all folk’s eyes most loathed of men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dwellers in Sparta, senates of treachery,</div>

<p class="noindent">Thus, in effect the mythological heroes were dragged upon the
stage before the Athenian populace and forced to affirm: “Your
friends shall be my friends, and your enemies my enemies.”</p>

<p>It would be easy greatly to extend this list, but I shall close
with two instances in which it is particularly obvious that
dramatic illusion has been sacrificed. In Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i>
the Theban herald inquires, “Who is despot of this land?”
which gives Theseus an opportunity to say (vss. 403 ff.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Equally effective with any jingoes in the audience would be the
scene in the <i>Persians</i>. Here Aeschylus “pays a pleasant compliment
to Athenian vanity” by means of the following dialogue
(vss. 231 ff.):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Atossa.</span> Where, O friends, is famous Athens on the broad face of the

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Far in the west: beside the setting of the lord of light the sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atossa.</span> This same Athens, my son Xerxes longed with much desire to

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Wisely: for all Greece submissive, when this city falls,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atossa.</span> Are they many? do they number men enough to meet my
son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> What they number was sufficient once to work the Medes
much harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atossa.</span> Other strength than numbers have they? wealth enough
within themselves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> They can boast a fount of silver, native treasure to the land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atossa.</span> Are they bowmen good? sure-feathered do their pointed
arrows fly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Not so. Stable spears they carry, massy armature of shields.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atossa.</span> Who is shepherd of this people? lord (ἐπιδεσπόζει) of the

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Slaves are they to no man living, subject to no earthly name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atossa.</span> How can such repel the onset of a strong united host?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> <i>How</i> Darius knew in Hellas, when he lost vast armies there.</p>

<p class="right">[Blackie’s translation]</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">From a dramatic standpoint these questions are out of place,
since Atossa’s ignorance is improbable and is shown to be feigned
by vss. 348 and 474 f. The first question is especially artificial.
Nevertheless, point by point Atossa has drawn out all the
distinctive points of pride in her son’s enemies: their commanding
influence, their numbers, their resources, their national
weapon, their freedom, and their previous exploits. Aeschylus
valued dramatic verisimilitude less highly than the fervent
response that each of these couplets would evoke in every
Athenian breast.</p>

<p>So we see that the tragic playwrights, more subtly than their
comic confrères but fully as effectively, knew how to commend
themselves to the good graces of the populace by incidents and
sentiments no less palatable than the nuts and figs of comedy.
If such conduct seem to some to be beneath the dignity of
transcendent geniuses like Aeschylus and Euripides, a corrective
may be found in the words of Schlegel:<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> “The dramatic poet
is, more than any other, obliged to court external form and loud
applause. But of course it is only in appearance that he thus
lowers himself to his hearers; while, in reality, he is elevating
them to himself.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONS<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></span></h2>

</div>

<p>Whether the use of masks in Greek drama originated in the
mere desire for a disguise or in some ritualistic observance has
not been definitely established. At any rate their employment
was peculiarly well adapted to the genius of the ancient theater.
First of all they enabled a small number of actors to carry a much
larger number of parts (see <a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>, above). Secondly, the mouthpiece
is claimed by some to have magnified the sound of the
actor’s voice, and thus helped to counteract the outstanding fact
in the physical arrangement of ancient theaters, viz., their huge
size (see <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>, above). But in particular I wish to stress their
bearing upon another feature of the classic drama—the hugeness
of ancient theaters, together with the lack of opera glasses,
made impossible an effect which modern audiences highly
appreciate. I refer to the delicate play of expression on the
mobile faces of the performers. In antiquity such refinements
could scarcely have been seen outside of the orchestra. A
partial substitute was occasionally found in a change of mask<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
during the performance. This became possible if a character
was off-stage at the time when his physical or mental state was
supposed to be modified by some misfortune or accident. Thus
when some one’s eyes are dashed out behind the scenes, as in
Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus the King</i>, Euripides’ <i>Hecabe</i> and <i>Cyclops</i>,
etc., the mask with which he appears after this event would
naturally be different from that previously worn. Similarly in
Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i> that hero, young and handsome, proudly
leaves the stage at vs. 1102. At vs. 1342 he is borne back in a
dying condition, battered and torn by his runaway team. It
is plausible to suppose that this change is reflected by a modification
of his mask and costume. Still another type is seen in
Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i>. A seer has demanded that
Creon’s son be slain to redeem the fatherland, but at vs. 990
Creon departs with the assurance that Menoeceus will seek
safety in flight. When he reappears at vs. 1308 his brow is said
to be clouded by the news that his son had changed his mind and
immolated himself for his country’s good.</p>

<p>At best such a change of masks was but a clumsy and inadequate
evasion of the difficulty; yet even this was out of the
question whenever the catastrophe befell the character while
on the scene. In these cases the dramatists sometimes try to
explain the immobility of the actor’s mask. An unusually
successful instance occurs in Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i>. Electra had
believed her brother dead, and now she unexpectedly holds him
in her arms, alive and well. But not a spark of joy can scintillate
across her wooden features either then or later. Her subsequent
passivity is motivated by Orestes’ request that she continue her
lamentations and not allow their mother to read her secret in
her radiant face (vss. 1296 ff.). Electra replies that ‘old hatred
of her mother is too ingrained to allow her countenance to be
seen wreathed in smiles, but that her tears will be tears of
joy,’ which has the merit of explaining also the present unresponsiveness
of her features. Sometimes the actor’s face is
hidden at times when strong emotions might be expected to
play thereon. For example, in Euripides’ <i>Orestes</i>, Electra and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
the chorus stand in the orchestra and look toward the palace
within which Helen is being slain and from which her dying cries
issue. Inasmuch as their backs are turned to the audience, the
spectators are free to suppose that their faces are working with
excitement and horror. This fiction will be destroyed as soon
as the performers wheel around toward the front again. Accordingly
Electra is made to say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse right">[Vss. 1313 ff.; Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Electra’s “trouble-clouded eye” does not refer to sorrow at
Helen’s death but at her brother’s evil plight, and has characterized
her mask from the beginning of the play.</p>

<p>Being largely balked in this matter, the Greeks characteristically
turned the limitation to good account. The mask-makers
did not attempt to fashion a detailed portrait—that
would have suffered from the same difficulty as the naked human
physiognomy; like our newspaper cartoonists, they reduced each
character to the fewest possible traits, which were suggested in
bold strokes and were easily recognizable by even the most remote
spectator. Under close inspection representations of ancient
masks seem grotesque and even absurd (Figs. <a href="#figure04">4</a>, <a href="#figure08">8</a>, <a href="#figure17">17-21</a>, <a href="#figure66">66</a>,
and <a href="#figure68">68 f.</a>), but it must be remembered that distance would to
a great extent obliterate this impression. Moreover, such masks
were admirably adapted to, and at the same time reinforced, the
Greek tendency to depict types rather than individuals (see
<a href="#Page_213">pp. 213</a> and <a href="#Page_266">266 f.</a>). On the modern stage masks are practically
unknown. We must not allow that fact to prejudice us against
their possible effectiveness. So respectable an authority as
Mr. Gordon Craig declares “the expression of the human face as
used by the theaters of the last few centuries” to be “spasmodic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
and ridiculous,” that “the mask is the only right medium of
portraying the expressions of the soul as shown through the
expressions of the face,” and that they “will be used in place of
the human face in the near future”; and Mr. Cornford testifies
to the baffling, tantalizing effect of a similar device at the
Elizabethan Stage Society’s representation of Marlowe’s <i>Doctor
Faustus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>The size of ancient theaters exercised an influence also in
another direction. In the absence of arches and domes or
modern steel girders it was impossible to roof over such a structure
without a multitude of supports to obstruct the view and
hearing. Accordingly, the proceedings were exposed to every
caprice of the weather. For example, in the time of Demetrius
Poliorcetes an unseasonable cold spell and frost broke up the
procession. On the other hand the lack of an adequate and
easily controlled artificial illuminant such as gas or electricity
would have prevented the satisfactory lighting of a roofed
theater, could they have built one. Therefore, like the Elizabethans,
their dramas were presented in the daytime, and the
constant harmony between lighting effects and dramatic situation,
which to us is a commonplace, was entirely beyond their
powers. But since it was also beyond their ken, it doubtless
did not bother them especially, and like much else was safely
left to the well-trained imaginations of the spectators. Thus
dramatic characters frequently address the heavenly constellations
in broad daylight, and ostensibly the entire action of the
<i>Rhesus</i> and much of that in Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i> fall within the
hours of night. Nevertheless, we know that the playwrights
were sometimes self-conscious concerning this discrepancy. In
Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i> most of the action is supposed to be laid in
Hades, and ancient opinion was unanimous in considering that
a place of gloom. Since the poet could not count upon the sun
going behind a cloud to suit his convenience, he undertook to
put the audience on their guard against the incongruity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
Toward the beginning of the play, when Dionysus is seeking
directions for his journey to the lower world and the scene is
still upon earth, Heracles tells him: “Next a breathing sound of
flutes will compass you about and you will see a light most fair,
<i>even as here</i>” (vss. 154 f.). Furthermore, shortly after the action
is transferred to the realm of Pluto, the matter is once more
called to the spectators’ attention by the chorus of initiates
singing (vss. 454 f.): “We alone have a sun and gracious light.”</p>

<p>So far as I have observed, the tragedians never stooped to
apologize for this absurdity, but they were willing, whenever
possible, to accommodate themselves to actual conditions. The
dramatic exercises are said to have begun at sunrise. Consequently,
it is not surprising that the action of tragedies like
Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i> and Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i>, which
stood first in the series presented on the same day, should
open before daybreak. I must add, however, that such scenes
occur also in comedies and in tragedies which did not stand first
in their series, both of which must have been presented in the
full light of day. These instances of incongruity are to be
explained by stating that the arrangements and physical conditions
which caused the Greek playwrights usually to crowd the
action of their dramas within a period of twenty-four hours (see
<a href="#Page_250">p. 250</a>, below) would also lead them to make the dramatic day
as long as possible by beginning the action of their plays at early
morning.</p>

<p>Lessing and others have unfavorably contrasted Voltaire’s
employment of ghosts with Shakespeare’s practice. The comparison
rests principally upon two points: that the ghost of
Hamlet’s father complied with “recognized ghostly conditions”
by appearing in the stillness of night and speaking to but one,
unaccompanied person, while the ghost of Ninus in <i>Sémiramis</i>
outraged accepted beliefs by stalking out of his tomb in broad
daylight and making his appearance before a large assembly.
Now it is interesting to observe that Greek practice is liable
to these same criticisms. Thus in Aeschylus’ <i>Persians</i> (vss.
681 ff.) the ghost of Darius appears in the full light of day and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
before his queen and no less than twelve councilors. In Euripides’
<i>Hecabe</i> (vss. 1 ff.) the difficulties are somewhat obviated
by placing the appearance of Polydorus’ ghost in the prologue,
before any other actor or the chorus has come in; and perhaps
Hecabe’s words in vss. 68 f., “O mirk of the night,” etc., are
intended to suggest that the preceding scene took place in darkness.
In any case, whatever make-believe the dramatists might
choose to practice, the considerations just mentioned, together
with the almost constant presence of the chorus, normally compelled
apparitions appearing in Greek drama to violate two
provisions in the standard code of ghostly etiquette.</p>

  the Theater at Thoricus in Attica</p>
  <p class="captionref"><a href="#Footnote_310">See p. 227, n. 1</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is well known that in the earliest extant Greek plays, viz.,
the <i>Suppliants</i>, <i>Persians</i>, and <i>Prometheus Bound</i> of Aeschylus,
the scene is laid in the open countryside with not a house in sight
and with no scenic accessories except an altar, tomb, or rock,
respectively. But that this circumstance was explicable by the
character of the Athenian theater did not become evident until
Dr. Dörpfeld’s excavations on that site in 1886, 1889, and 1895
(see <a href="#Page_65">pp. 65 ff.</a>, above, and Figs. <a href="#figure32">32</a> and <a href="#figure32a">32<i>a</i></a>). From 499 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> until
about 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the theater at Athens consisted of an orchestral
circle nearly eighty feet in diameter and somewhat south of the
present orchestra, and an auditorium arranged partly about it on
the Acropolis slope. Immediately behind the orchestra there was
no scene-building or back scene, but a six-foot declivity. Only
within the orchestra itself, at the center or to one side, might
there be erected for temporary use some such theatrical “property”
as an altar or tomb. Consequently it was inevitable that
playwrights of the early fifth century in choosing an imaginary
scene for their plays should react to these physical conditions
and localize the dramatic action in more or less deserted spots.
Even as late as Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i> (467 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>),
although the scene no longer is laid in the countryside but on the
Theban Acropolis, yet this is still a place without inhabitants or
houses. It should be noted that at this period the exclusive
mode of ingress and egress was by the side entrances, the parodi;
under normal conditions, any movement into the orchestra or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
out of it, at the rear, was entirely precluded by the declivity.
That such a primitive theater would suffice for the needs of that
or even a later period is proved by the remains of the structure
at Thoricus (Figs. <a href="#figure70">70 f.</a>),<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> which was never brought to a higher
state of development (see <a href="#Page_103">p. 103</a>, above), and by the fact that
even at a later period dramatists sometimes voluntarily reverted
to this unpretentious stage setting. For example, in Sophocles’
<i>Oedipus at Colonus</i> the background represented the untrodden
grove of the Eumenides, so that practically all the entrances and
exits were restricted to the parodi. An exceptional rear exit is
afforded by Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, and an exceptional
rear entrance by the next play in the trilogy, the <i>Prometheus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Unbound</i>. We have already seen (see <a href="#Page_166">pp. 166 f.</a> and <a href="#Page_174">174</a>, above)
how in the former play the hero, being represented by a dummy,
cannot speak until Hephaestus leaves the scene by a side entrance
and makes his way behind the rock upon which Prometheus is
bound. In the absence of a scene-building, the six-foot declivity
must have been utilized to conceal the second half of this movement.
Now the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> ends as the Titan and his
crag sink into the depths; at the beginning of the <i>Prometheus
Unbound</i> this crag has emerged from the abyss. What was the
reason for this maneuver? Obviously to enable an actor to be
substituted for the lay figure of Prometheus. So long as the hero
was fixed in his place, an actor concealed behind him experienced
little difficulty in speaking his lines for him; but as the time drew
near for his release a living impersonator was required. How
was this substitution managed? I conceive that a wooden
frame-work, rudely suggesting a rock, was propped up at the
outer extremity of the orchestra. At the moment of the catastrophe
the supports were removed and the structure allowed to
collapse into the declivity. After an interval sufficient for the
exchange had elapsed, the rocky background was once more
raised into its place and braced.</p>

  <p class="captionref"><a href="#Footnote_310">See p. 227, n. 1</a></p>
</div>

<p>About 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> an advance step in theatrical conditions was
taken when a scene-building was erected immediately behind the
orchestra, where the declivity had previously been (see <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>,
above). This first scene-building must have been very simple,
probably of only one story, without either parascenia or proscenium
(<a href="#figure74">Fig. 74</a>), and capable of being readily rebuilt so as to
be accommodated to the needs of different plays. The extant
dramas show that from the first the new background was pierced
by at least one door and that the number was soon raised to three,
though they were not all used in every production. The different
doorways were conventionally thought of as leading into as
many separate houses or buildings. Thus, whereas the actors
had hitherto been able to enter and depart only through the two
parodi, from one to three additional means of entrance were now
provided. Moreover, the mere fact of having a background was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
no small advantage. For example, it enabled Aeschylus to
introduce a distinct improvement in dramatic technique. Heretofore
scenes of violence must either have been boldly enacted
before the spectators’ eyes or reported by a messenger. Since
the sacrosanctity of the actor while engaged in a performance
and the Greeks’ aesthetic sense interfered with the first alternative
(see <a href="#Page_127">pp. 127-32</a>, above), doubtless the second had usually
been resorted to. Now Aeschylus is said to have invented the
very effective device of having a character killed behind the
scenes during the play. In view of the physical conditions it will
be understood that the failure of Aeschylus’ predecessors to
avail themselves of this expedient was due to no lack of inventive
genius on their part but simply to the entire absence in their time
of a back scene to use for the purpose. It is not known just how
long it took Aeschylus to discover this possibility in the new
arrangements; but it was certainly not later than the <i>Agamemnon</i>
(458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), in which the king’s agonized death cries from behind
the scenes (vss. 1343 and 1345) still have power to affect even
modern audiences. Further modifications of this artifice have
already been mentioned on <a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most troublesome problems that confront a playwright
is inventing plausible motives to explain the entrances
and exits of his characters. The fundamental nature of this
problem appears from the words of a modern dramatist,
Mr. Alfred Sutro: “Before I start writing the dialogue of a play,
I make sure that I shall have an absolutely free hand over the
entrances and exits: in other words, that there is ample and
legitimate reason for each character appearing in any particular
scene, and ample motive for his leaving it.” Now in the interior
scene, and especially in the box set, moderns have a marvelously
flexible instrument for shifting personages on and off the
scene; yet few can avoid abusing this resource and can repeat
Mr. Bernard Shaw’s boast: “My people get on and off the stage
without requiring four doors to a room which in real life would
have only one.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> To the ancient writer the difficulty was still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
greater. Prior to 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when some uninhabited spot was
perforce chosen as the scene of action and the two parodi were
the sole means of ingress, it was fairly easy to motivate a person’s
<i>first</i> entrance and withdrawal; but a reappearance proved a
more difficult matter, and each additional character complicated
the problem still further. Consequently, the ancient playwrights
not infrequently frankly abandoned all search for a solution and
considered that to leave a character standing in idleness during
a whole scene or choral ode was less awkward and improbable
than any motive which they could provide for his exit and
re-entrance. Thus in Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i>, Danaus enters the
orchestra with the chorus consisting of his daughters and remains
at the altar, without a single word to say, during their parodus
of a hundred and seventy-five lines. After a short scene the
king of Argos appears, and then for over two hundred lines (vss.
234-479) Danaus is again ignored (see <a href="#Page_163">pp. 163 f.</a>, above). In this
play the town of Argos is thought of as lying some distance away
from the scene of action. Only an important errand would take
Danaus there, and evidently the poet experienced difficulty in
inventing as many errands as dramatic propriety required.
Similarly at vss. 181 ff. of Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i>,
Eteocles rebukes the chorus for their fears and lamentations;
yet apparently he has been standing there during their whole
parodus (vss. 78-180) without a single word of protest! But it
was not characteristic of the Greek genius tamely to submit to
hindrances, and accordingly we are not surprised that Aeschylus
actually secured a striking dramatic effect by leaving characters
like Niobe and Achilles for considerable intervals speechless and
immovable on the scene. When finally uttered, their startling
cries of anguish were greatly enhanced by their previous long-continued
silence. It may not be amiss to note that Molière
obtained similar suspense by means quite opposite. In <i>Tartuffe</i>,
contrary to all the accepted rules, the principal character does
not appear upon the scene until after the beginning of the third
act. But the conversation and disputes of the other dramatic
personages have so inflamed our curiosity concerning him that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
can scarcely wait to catch a glimpse of him, and his entrance
finally is thrice as effective as if it had come earlier in the play.</p>

<p>The erection of a scene-building about 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> somewhat
relieved the difficulty of the playwrights’ problem. First of all
the places of entrance were increased 50 per cent or more.
Secondly, the new entrances were nearer the orchestra than were
the parodi and enabled an actor to come in or depart more
quickly. Thirdly, the presence of buildings almost required the
scene to be laid in a town or city and correspondingly multiplied
the possible motives for visiting it. And finally, since the doorways
often represented the homes of certain of the dramatic
characters, no elaborate motivation was needed to explain their
passing in and out at frequent intervals. When his work was
done, the useless actor could be temporarily eliminated with
neatness and dispatch. These considerations and the introduction
of the third actor at about the same time (see <a href="#Page_167">p. 167</a>,
above) soon doubled the amount of coming and going in the
plays (cf. Mooney, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 54). The influence of the former
factor appears in Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i>, the action of which
takes place before a temple. It so happens, however, that the
temple doors in this case are not used for entrances and exits.
Consequently of all Euripides’ tragedies this one has the least
passing to and fro. On the other hand the influence of the second
factor is seen in the fact that this piece and Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus
at Colonus</i> (see <a href="#Page_227">p. 227</a>, above), both making practically no use of
their back scene but both employing three actors, are higher in
“action” than the corresponding plays of Aeschylus, which
belong to the two-actor period.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when all is said, the erection of a scene-building
still left the ancient dramatists far behind the moderns in the easy
and plausible motivation of their characters’ movements, and
no further advance (from this point of view) was subsequently
made in the theatrical arrangements. All the dramatic personages
still had to come to the same (usually a public) place;
they could not dodge in at one door and out at another at their
creator’s caprice, but whether entering or leaving had to walk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
a considerable distance in plain view of the spectators. Consequently
the silent actor is found after 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> as well as before.
Thus in Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i> one or more characters are being
neglected at almost every point. But in my opinion this phenomenon
is no longer due primarily to the inadequacy of the
theatrical arrangements but to other considerations. For example,
the limited number of actors often resulted in prolonged
or awkward silence on the part of a character who was being
impersonated by a mute (see <a href="#Page_174">pp. 174-82</a>, above). Again, in the
<i>Alcestis</i>, after Heracles has brought the queen back from her
grave, she utters never a word. Euripides himself explains this
on the ground that she may not speak until her consecration to
the gods of the lower world be undone and the third day come
(vss. 1144 ff.). This is a clever pretext but not the real reason.
Nor do I think, as some do, that in this instance the limitation
of actors is responsible, since only two actors speak in this scene
and the play belongs to the three-actor period. Alcestis’ silence
springs rather from the impossibility of placing in her mouth a
message worthy of her experiences, one which “telling what it
is to die had surely added praise to praise.” Still again the
silence frequently arises from inability to master the technique
of the trialogue (see <a href="#Page_169">pp. 169 f.</a>) or from the nature of the plot.
In any trial scene it is almost inevitable that both the judge and
the accused should remain inactive for considerable intervals.
Thus in Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i> the silence of Athena (vss. 585-673
and 711-33) and of Orestes (vss. 244-63, 307-435, 490-585,
and 614-743) is scarcely more noteworthy than that of the Duke
and Antonio in Act IV of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>. When his
case was about to be decided, Orestes terminated a silence of one
hundred and thirty lines by the thrilling ejaculation, “O Phoebus
Apollo, what shall the judgment be!” (vs. 744)—another example
of the dexterity with which the Greek poets could transmute
base metal into pure gold.</p>

<p>It need not be said that the same difficulty of plausible
motivation puzzled the comic as well as the tragic writers of
antiquity, and they extricated themselves with no less ingenuity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
in their own way. For the further unfolding of the plot in
Plautus’ <i>Pseudolus</i> it became necessary that that crafty slave
should explain to his accomplices certain developments which
had already been represented on the scene. Actually to repeat
the facts would have been tedious to the spectators, while to
motive an exit for all the parties concerned until the information
could be imparted and then to motive their re-entrance might
have proved difficult and certainly would have caused an awkward
pause in the action. The poet therefore chose the bolder
course of dropping for the moment all dramatic illusion and at
the same time of slyly poking fun at the conventions of his art:
“This play is being performed for the sake of these spectators.
They have been here, and are aware of developments. I’ll tell
<i>you</i> about them afterwards”(!) (vss. 720 f.).</p>

<p>We have already referred to the fact that topographical
conditions in Athens gave rise to a convention regarding the
significance of the parodi (see <a href="#Page_208">p. 208</a>, above). As the spectator
sat on the south slope of the Acropolis at Athens, with the
orchestra and scene-buildings before him, the harbor of the
Piraeus and the market place lay toward his right and the open
country on his left (<a href="#figure29">Fig. 29</a>). And since the theater was roofless
and the performances given in daylight, these relationships were
visible and must at all times have been present to the consciousness
of the audience. The matter was, therefore, one of more
consequence than in the modern theater, where many spectators,
being unable to see points of orientation outside, would be
puzzled to indicate the points of the compass. In the Athenian
theater, on the contrary, if the scene were laid locally no poet
or stage manager could have allowed a character from the Piraeus
to enter by the left (east) parodus without committing a patent
absurdity. In such a case there was, at the beginning, no
convention; the plays simply reacted to actual local conditions.
But the fifth-century plays were rarely laid in Athens, and in
them comparatively little is said of harbor, market place, or
countryside, whether at Athens or elsewhere. Apart from a rigid
convention, there would be no point in staging Aeschylus’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
<i>Suppliants</i>, the scene of which is laid just outside the city of
Argos, or Aristophanes’ <i>Birds</i>, whose scene is supposed to be in
the clouds, in such a way as to conform to Athenian topography.
In fact, incidental allusions in the fifth-century plays, the comparative
infrequency in them of references to harbor, country, and
market place, and minor infelicities arising from any attempt to
foist this convention upon them, would all seem to indicate that
these plays had been written without much regard for local
geography. But with increasing frequency Athens became the
imaginary scene of comedies, and the relationships which had
become a fixed rule for them were transferred to tragedy also,
and soon to other theaters whose setting bore little or no resemblance
to that of the theater of Dionysus Eleuthereus. Certainly
by the time of New Comedy the convention was firmly established,
and except for characters leaving or entering the houses
in the background almost every exit or entrance was oriented for
the audience with reference to country, harbor, or market place.
When Greek comedy was transplanted to Italian soil the convention
was taken over, too, and reappears, possibly with some
modification, in the plays of Plautus and Terence.</p>

<p>Regardless of the convention, however, and the period of its
origin there is one blemish which careful stage managers nowadays
seek to avoid. When a door closes upon a departing
character, it should not be immediately opened again to admit
another character, whom the first character must have brushed
against in the hall. A slight pause is somehow provided to
enable the two characters to avoid meeting and to give the sense
of space beyond the room on the stage. Now in Euripides’
<i>Alcestis</i> a violation of this common-sense principle of stage
craft seems to occur. At vs. 747 Admetus and the chorus have
departed bearing the body of Alcestis to its last resting place.
In the ensuing scene Heracles at last learns the identity of the
deceased and at vs. 860 rushes out to wrestle with the king of the
dead beside the grave. <i>In the very next verse</i> Admetus returns.
According to the Hellenistic convention Heracles must have
departed and Admetus have re-entered through the parodus at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
the audience’s left. But which parodus was employed does not
in this case greatly matter. The point is that since Heracles
was bound for the spot from which Admetus was returning, they
must have used <i>the same parodus</i>. Nevertheless, later developments
show that they did not meet; indeed, certain telling
features of the dénouement would have been spoiled if they had.
Yet how could they avoid doing so? The play furnishes no
reply. So far as I can see the only way in which the difficulty
can be obviated is by supposing that vss. 747-860 take place
before a slightly different part of the palace from the rest of the
play. Scholars, however, do not commonly accept a change of
scene in this piece (see <a href="#Page_250">pp. 250 f.</a>, below).</p>

<p>The space between the two parodi and leading past the scene-building
was usually thought of as representing a street or roadway
(see <a href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>, above). In the Hellenistic theater at Athens a
stone proscenium ran across the front of the scene-building
from one parascenium to the other (see <a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a>, above) (<a href="#figure38">Fig. 38</a>),
and it is likely that a wooden proscenium occupied the same
space from about 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> It is true that the stone foundation
of the parascenia, which were probably erected to serve as a
framework for the proscenium, cannot go back of 415-421 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> at
the earliest (see <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a> and <a href="#Footnote_142">n. 1</a>, above). But it is fair to assume
that parascenia entirely of wood were erected as an experiment a
few years before permanent foundations were provided for them,
and the proscenium colonnade seems to have been employed at
least as early as Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i> (428 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and Aristophanes’
<i>Clouds</i> (423 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Confirmation for this conclusion
may be found in the fact that the crane (μηχανή) was introduced
at about this same time (see <a href="#Page_289">p. 289</a>, below). When the scene was
laid before a private house or a palace, the colonnade was in
place as signifying its prothyron (πρόθυρον) or “porch.” When
the background was thought of as a temple the proscenium was
its <i>pronaos</i> (πρόναος) or “portico.” Moreover, when a less
conventional setting was required, painted panels (πίνακες)
could be inserted in the intercolumniations in order to suggest
the desired locality, and in some theaters the proscenium columns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
were shaped so as to hold such panels more firmly in place (<a href="#figure72">Fig.
72</a>).<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Thus the action in Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i> takes
place before a grove, and that in Plautus’ <i>The Fisherman’s Rope</i>,
along a beach. The interruption of natural scenery by columns
at regular intervals would be disturbing to us; that it did not
seem so to the Greeks was due not only to their ignorance of
modern scenery but also to the sketchy shorthand which they
practiced in other fields of art. On ancient vases, for example,
a whole forest is frequently represented by a single tree. A
similar convention obtains in the drama of modern Persia, where
“the desert is represented by a handful of sand on the platform,
the river Tigris by a leather basin full of water.”<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Sophocles
is said to have invented scene painting during the lifetime of
Aeschylus (see <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>, above), but this must be interpreted as
meaning that he had the panels applied directly to the front of
the scene-building, the proscenium being not yet introduced.
It has also been suggested, on the basis of certain vase paintings
(<a href="#figure73">Fig. 73</a>),<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> that an actual porch (prothyron) was sometimes built<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
extending from the center of the proscenium or taking the place
of a proscenium and extending from the center of the scene-building’s
front wall. But perhaps these paintings are only
conventionalized representations of the proscenium colonnade
itself. In any case it is important to observe that no background
corresponding to the scene-building is indicated on the vases.</p>

</div>

<p>Now it will be noted that these theatrical arrangements
made no provision for an interior scene. The dramatic action
was necessarily laid in the open air, usually before a palace,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
private house, or temple. Though occasional plays, like Mr.
Louis Parker’s <i>Pomander Walk</i>, show that the thing can still be
managed, in general modern dramatists would be paralyzed by
such a requirement. Nor is it correct to state that the classical
poets “seldom had occasion to show an interior scene.” The
truth is precisely the opposite: having no way in which to show
an interior they were constrained to rest content with alfresco
scenes. Yet the situation was not so desperate as it would seem.
Corneille pointed out that Greek kings could meet and speak in
public without a breach of etiquette.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> At the French court, and
consequently on the French stage, such conduct would have been
intolerable. In the second place the mildness of a southern
climate justified some practices which might appear strange to
more northern peoples. Many things which we would consider
must be kept strictly within doors would sometimes take place
in the street. Semi-privacy was afforded by porches and
porticoes, that is, theatrically speaking, by the colonnade of the
proscenium. Our nearest parallel would be sun parlors or
screened porches and even these fall short. Doubtless this
difference in weather conditions has something to do with the
fact that modern playwrights of the classic school, who, though
freed from the material restrictions of the ancients, have yet
slavishly imitated them in so much else, have not followed them
in this partiality for outdoor scenes. Allowance must also be
made for the fact that in comedy the characters uniformly
belonged to the lower strata of society. Accordingly we need
feel little surprise that in Aristophanes’ <i>Clouds</i> (vss. 1 ff.)
Strepsiades and his son are disclosed sleeping before their home
in the open air, though we have no reason to believe that they
are either actual or prospective victims of tuberculosis. In
Euripides’ <i>Orestes</i> (vss. 1 ff.) the matricide, wasted by illness,
lies on his couch before the palace in Argos under his sister’s
care. In Plautus’ <i>The Churl</i> (vss. 448 ff.), Phronesium reclines
on a bed before the house, pretending that she has given birth to
a child. In Plautus’ <i>The Haunted House</i> (vss. 248 ff.), Philematium<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
asks her maid for a mirror, jewel box, etc., and a scene
of prinking ensues in the open air. Scenes of outdoor feasting
and carousing are too numerous to deserve individual mention.
I cannot accept the contention that the action of such scenes
takes place in an “imaginary interior.” They are frankly out
of doors; in this connection such expressions as “outside the
house,” “before the doors,” etc., are frequent. These scenes
were enacted in the colonnade of the proscenium and are correctly
copied from ancient life. Of course I concede that in real life
they would take place indoors as often as out, or even more often;
but they were common enough as open-air scenes to justify the
playwrights in constantly transcribing them in this fashion.</p>

<p>But the significance of the considerations mentioned in the
last paragraph must not be overestimated. The difficulty
arising from physical conditions in the theater was cumulative.
In other words the placing of any particular scene in the open
air was generally justifiable by ancient habits of living and not
difficult to motivate; but to place <i>every</i> scene in <i>every</i> play out
of doors and under these conditions to invent a plausible motive
for every entrance taxed the dramatists’ powers to the utmost
and sometimes exceeded them.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> No wonder, then, that occasionally
they abandoned all attempts to explain their characters’
movements and coolly allowed them to leave their dwellings and
to speak, without apology or excuse, of the most confidential
matters in a public place. Many instances of this license,
however, seem to have been conditioned by definite rules. For
example, if a character leaves his house while engaged in conversation
with another, no reason is given for their entrance,
i.e., for their not having concluded the conversation where it was
begun. Examples of this technique do not occur until about
400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (see <a href="#Page_310">p. 310</a>, below, and the instances there cited).
Secondly, no entrance motive is provided when a character is to
take part in a dialogue with another who is already on the scene
and whose own entrance has been motived. Thus in Euripides’
<i>Alcestis</i>, Heracles enters at vs. 476 in order to seek hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
at Admetus’ palace; at vs. 506 the chorus announces the king’s
emergence, which is entirely unmotived. Six other examples of
this technique occur in Greek tragedy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in general the ancient playwrights displayed
an amazing fertility of invention in explaining why their characters
came out of doors and spoke in so public a place of matters
which might more naturally have been reserved for greater
privacy. Thus in Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i>, Apollo explains his leaving
Admetus’ palace on the ground of the pollution which a corpse
would bring upon all within the house (vss. 22 f.) and Alcestis
herself, though in a dying condition, fares forth to look for the
last time upon the sun in heaven (vs. 206). Oedipus is so concerned
in the afflictions of his subjects that he cannot endure the
thought of making inquiries through a servant but comes forth
to learn the situation in person (Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus the King</i>,
vss. 6 f.); Carion is driven out of doors by the smoke of sacrifice
upon the domestic altar (Aristophanes’ <i>Plutus</i>, vss. 821 f.);
Polyphemus leaves his cave intending to visit his brothers for a
carousal (cf. Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i>, vss. 445 f. and 507 ff.). In
Euripides’ <i>Andromache</i>, Hermione’s nurse, worn out in the
attempt to save her mistress from self-destruction, hurries out
and appeals to the chorus for assistance; a moment later Hermione
herself escapes from the restraining clutches of her
attendants and rushes upon the stage (vss. 816 ff.). Agathon
cannot compose his odes in the winter time unless he bask in
the sunlight (Aristophanes’ <i>Women at the Thesmophoria</i>, vss.
67 f.). In Plautus’ <i>The Haunted House</i> (vss. 1 ff.) one slave is
driven out of doors by another as the result of a quarrel. The
lovelorn Phaedra teases for light and air (Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i>,
vss. 178 ff.). Medea’s nurse apologizes for soliloquizing before the
house with the excuse that the sorrows within have stifled her
and caused her to seek relief by proclaiming them to earth and
sky (cf. Euripides’ <i>Medea</i>, vss. 56 ff. and <a href="#Page_307">pp. 307 f.</a>, below). And
Antigone informs her sister that she has summoned her out of
doors in order to speak with her alone (Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i>,
vss. 18 f.), as if that were the most natural place in the world for
a tête-à-tête. In connection with this last instance it must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
remembered that the interior of ancient houses was arranged
differently than ours and was more favorable for eavesdropping
(cf. Terence’s <i>Phormio</i>, vss. 862-69).</p>

<p>The difficulty inherent in the exclusive use of exterior scenes
appears very strikingly in Euripides’ <i>Cyclops</i>. Here the action
would naturally take place in Polyphemus’ cave, as it does in
Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i>; but, theatrical conditions making that impossible,
the scene is laid before the cave’s mouth. Contrary to
verisimilitude, therefore, the poet is obliged to allow Odysseus
to pass in and out without let or hindrance. Why, then, does
he make no attempt to escape? Euripides anticipated this query
and explained Odysseus’ remaining by regard for his companions’
safety (vss. 479 ff.). But why was it not equally feasible for his
comrades to leave the cave and for all to be saved together?
The poet can think of no better motive than that Odysseus’ pride
and sense of honor caused him to desire to take vengeance on
Polyphemus for having murdered some of his followers (vss.
694 f.).</p>

<p>Being unable actually to represent an interior scene the Greek
playwrights gladly availed themselves of several substitutes.
The most common of these was the messenger’s speech (see <a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>,
above), by which occurrences that had taken place indoors were
related to the chorus or to actors before the house. Another substitute
was found in the cries of characters murdered behind the
scenes (see <a href="#Page_128">pp. 128</a> and <a href="#Page_229">229</a>, above). A third method consisted
in throwing open the doors in the background and revealing a
scene of murder done within (see <a href="#Page_128">p. 128</a>, above). We are told
further that sometimes, when the doors were flung open, a platform,
with a tableau mounted upon it, was pushed forward for a
few moments (see the discussion of the <i>eccylema</i> on <a href="#Page_284">pp. 284-89</a>,
below). A fourth evasion of the restriction occurs in Euripides’
<i>Hippolytus</i>, vss. 565 ff. Phaedra from her couch in the proscenium
colonnade hears the voices of her confidential slave and
Hippolytus engaged in conversation within doors. She invites
the chorus in the orchestra near by to join her in listening at the
door—a proposal which for obvious dramatic reasons the choreutae
cannot accept; but her own cries and exclamations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
despair as she listens stir the audience much more profoundly
than the conversation itself could have done. Thus the main
portion of the dialogue between Hippolytus and the slave is
supposed to take place indoors. It is concluded before the house,
the two interlocutors entering the stage at vs. 600.</p>

<p>Still again, the dramatists of New Comedy were fond of
representing a character in the act of passing through a doorway
and shouting back parting injunctions to those within—an
artifice which is sufficiently transparent and is justly ridiculed
in Terence’s <i>Andrian Girl</i>. A nurse has been summoned in a
confinement case and issues her final instructions while leaving
the house. Simo, who thinks no child has been born and that
it is all a trick to deceive him, turns fiercely upon the scheming
slave at his side: “Who that knows you would not believe this
to be the product of your brain? She did not tell what must be
done for the mother in her presence; but after taking her departure
she screams from the street to the attendants within. O
Davus, do you scorn me so? Pray do I seem so suitable a
victim for you to beguile with such transparent stratagems?
You ought to work out the details of your plots more exactly,
so that I might at least <i>seem</i> to be feared in case I learned the
truth” (vss. 489 ff.). Be it noted, however, that such a stickler
for realism as Ibsen occasionally made use of this same device
(cf. <i>Pillars of Society</i>, Acts II and III). A close parallel occurs
in Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i>, vss. 1003 ff.</p>

<p>As a final illustration of the artificiality of the exterior scene
I may refer to the manner in which characters are brusquely
called out of their homes to meet the demands of the dramatic
situation. Thus in Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i> a messenger
enters and unceremoniously shouts to his queen within doors:</p>

<p class="noindent">To judge by such a dramatic expedient, the front walls of ancient

scene 1) before Brabantio can be brought to his window. Perhaps
the most amusing instance of this convention occurs in
Plautus’ <i>Braggart Captain</i>. In that play a slave had to be
deluded into believing that two women of identical appearance
lived in adjoining houses. Accordingly he is first sent into one
house and then into the other, while directions are shouted to
the one woman in question to move back and forth by means
of a secret passage so as always to meet him (vss. 523 ff.).
This of course presupposes that the walls will be thin enough
for the woman to hear through but too thick for the slave
to do so!</p>

<p>The publicity thus inevitably attending conversations of the
most private nature was rendered still more incongruous by the
constant presence of the chorus; but this topic has already been
treated on <a href="#Page_154">pages 154-57</a>, above.</p>

<p>Whether the fifth-century theater was provided with a drop
curtain has often been discussed. I am inclined to think there
is no conclusive evidence for the constant and regular use of one.
The considerations upon which the argument mainly rests are
a priori. That is to say, in several Greek plays the actors must
arrange themselves and be in position before the action begins.
This is the situation in Euripides’ <i>Orestes</i> and Aristophanes’
<i>Clouds</i> (see <a href="#Page_238">p. 238</a>, above). Did Orestes take to his sick bed in
full view of the assembled audience? But he is said (cf. vs. 39)
already to have been there for five days! And though the
action of the <i>Clouds</i> begins just before dawn, Strepsiades and his
son are supposed to have lain before the house all night. In such
matters we must not permit our own prepossessions to mislead
us. In mediaeval drama though a character was in view of the
audience he could be thought of as, in effect, behind the scenes
until his part began. Similarly in oriental theaters today
performers are treated as if they could put on the mask of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
invisibility. The only standing concession which I can make
to modern feeling consists in granting that the proscenium
columns partially screened the actors from the audience while
they were taking their places. In my opinion the nearest
approach to the use of a curtain occurs in Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i> and
is quite exceptional. That hero committed suicide on the stage,
and his body was found in a woodland glen (νάπος, vs. 892) near
the seashore. I suppose that one of the side doors in the front
of the scene-building<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> was left open to represent the entrance
to the glen, and that around and behind it were set panels
painted to suggest the woodland coast and the glen (see <a href="#Page_235">pp. 235 f.</a>,
above). Into this opening Ajax collapsed as he fell upon his
sword. At vs. 915, Tecmessa “conceals him wholly with this
enfolding robe.” Possibly this means that the cloth was
fastened about the corpse and across the doorway, thus enabling
a mute or a lay figure to be substituted for the corpse and releasing
this actor to appear as Teucer in the remainder of the
play (see <a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>, above). Whatever the means employed, it is
certain that a substitution was effected.</p>

<p>It has often been maintained that the abrupt endings of so
many modern plays is due to the fact that we possess a drop
curtain which can be brought down upon the action with a bang,
and that the quieter endings of, for example, Elizabethan plays
arise from their being written for curtainless theaters. I do
not entirely disapprove of this suggestion, but wish to point out
that the difference originates, at least in part, also in a difference
in taste at different times and among different peoples. It is
true that the Greeks probably had no drop curtain and that their
dramas usually end upon a note of calm. But the same kind
of close is normal in other fields of their literature, where the
presence or absence of a curtain did not enter into consideration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
For example, there is a distinct tendency for modern orators to
close speeches with a peroration which is intended to sweep
auditors off their feet. Not so in Greek oratory. “Wherever
pity, terror, anger, or any passionate feeling is uttered or invited,
this tumult is resolved in a final calm; and where such tumult
has place in the peroration, it subsides before the last sentences
of all.”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> The same situation obtains likewise in the case of the
Greek epic as in Homer’s <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONS (<i>CONTINUED</i>): THE UNITIES<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></span></h2>

</div>

<p>The dramatic unities, three principles governing the structure
of drama and supposedly derived from Aristotle’s <i>Poetics</i>, are a
subject of perennial interest. They are known as the unities
of time, place, and action, respectively, and require that “the
action of a play should be represented as occurring in one place,
within one day, and with nothing irrelevant to the plot.” The
essential facts concerning them were recognized at least as long
ago as the publication of Lessing’s <i>Hamburgische Dramaturgie</i>
(1767). But so deep-rooted is the popular impression that the
Greeks formulated these rules arbitrarily and observed them
slavishly that no attempt to state the true situation can be
superfluous. The current doctrine is based on the fact that the
classic dramatists in France and Italy blindly obeyed the rules
as a heritage of the past, without regard to the demands of the
theater at their own disposal; and, consequently, the inference
has been easily and naturally drawn that the ancient practice
was equally irrational.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>But in the Greek theater, where there was no drop curtain,
no scenery to shift, and a chorus almost continuously present, a
change of scene was difficult to indicate visually. Nevertheless
Aristotle nowhere mentions the unity of place, and the Greek
dramatists not infrequently violate it. The most familiar
instances occur in Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i> and Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i>.
The former play opens at the temple of Apollo in Delphi, whither
the avenging Furies have pursued Orestes after his mother’s
murder. During a momentary lapse from their watchfulness
Orestes makes his escape, but the Furies soon awaken and take
up the trail once more. The scene is thus left entirely vacant
(vs. 234) and is supposed to change to Athens, where all parties
presently appear for the famous trial before the Council of the
Areopagus. The beginning of the latter play takes place before
Ajax’ tent, and Sophocles wished to introduce the very unusual
motive of having a scene of violence enacted before the audience.
As the presence of the chorus was an insuperable obstacle to such
a deed, Ajax was allowed to leave the scene and, suspicion being
soon aroused, the chorus was sent in search of him (vs. 814).
Thus, the scene is again entirely deserted by both actors and
chorus, and Ajax returns, not to his tent, but to some lonely spot
near the seashore (see <a href="#Page_129">pp. 129</a> and <a href="#Page_244">244</a>, above). This was by far
the most natural and logical method of leading up to a change of
scene, was infinitely superior to Shakespeare’s practice in <i>King
Henry V</i>, where Chorus is introduced in the prologue of each act
to acquaint the spectators with the scene of the succeeding action,
but was so difficult to motivate that only some half a dozen
examples are known to us in the whole Greek drama. On the
other hand, such a technical device was usually not well adapted
to represent considerable shifts of scene, since it would seem
unnatural for so large a body of persons as the chorus always to
accompany the dramatic characters to widely separated localities.
To this general restriction, however, the <i>Eumenides</i> furnishes a
brilliant exception, because it was the especial duty of the Furies
to track the guilty Orestes wherever he might flee. In Old
Comedy, ever fantastic and intentionally impossible, greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
freedom was naturally allowed than in tragedy, so that in
Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i> no less than five different scenes are
successively required (see <a href="#Page_88">pp. 88-90</a>, above).</p>

<p>At the same time the need of such scene-shifting was largely
obviated by the arbitrary placing of almost all scenes before a
building, by the exclusion of interior scenes, and by the various
devices substituted therefor (see <a href="#Page_237">pp. 237-42</a>, above). In particular
the use of the messenger’s speech enabled dramatists to bring
indirectly before their audiences events which had taken place,
not merely in the scene-house interior, but at far distant spots.
Very commonly the unity of place was observed by conventionally
bringing together as close neighbors structures or localities
which would actually be separated by considerable intervals.
Thus the murderers of Agamemnon would not wish his grave
to stare them in the face and to remind their subjects of their
crime; nevertheless in Aeschylus’ <i>Libation-Bearers</i> palace and
tomb stand side by side. Likewise in Euripides’ <i>Helen</i>, King
Theoclymenus has buried his father in front of his palace. Now
these arrangements are not to be interpreted in the light of the
prehistoric custom of placing the dead within the house or before
its threshold. It is purely a theatrical convention, and Euripides
shows what he thought of it by deeming it necessary to put an
excuse on the Egyptian king’s lips:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hail, my sire’s tomb!—for at my palace-gate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proteus, I buried thee, <i>to greet thee so</i>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still as I enter and pass forth mine halls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee, father, I thy son Theoclymenus hail.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Vss. 1165 ff.; Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Many similar instances of incongruous juxtaposition in Greek
drama can be cited, and those who remember the use of the
continuous set in mediaeval theaters will feel no surprise.</p>

<p>Slightly different but no less efficacious is the method of
procedure in the <i>Persians</i>. For dramatic effect Aeschylus
wished to introduce the ghost of Darius. But according to
ancient notions on the subject ghosts do not normally wander
far from their tombs, and the real grave of Darius was at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
Persepolis. Furthermore, under the conditions supposed the
Persian elders, the royal messenger, and Xerxes himself would
not naturally resort thither. Consequently, without the slightest
compunction, Aeschylus transferred the dead monarch’s
tomb to Susa!</p>

<p>Sometimes the unity of place was observed by causing a
character to come to a spot to which he would not naturally
resort. The scene of Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i>, for instance,
is laid in Thebes, and the poet wished to show a meeting of the
Theban king and his brother. Since the latter is considered a
traitor and the enemy of his country, is in banishment and
at the head of an invading army, such a meeting in real life
would almost inevitably be held between the hostile lines. Yet
Polynices is forced to intrust his head to the lion’s jaws and
enter the city. He expresses his own misgivings in vss. 261 ff.,
concluding:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet do I trust my mother—and mistrust,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who drew me to come hither under truce.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Vss. 272 f.; Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At vss. 357 ff. he alludes to the matter once more.</p>

<p>Similarly, a character is oftentimes forced to remain upon
the scene of action when he would not naturally do so. Thus,
in Plautus’ <i>Menaechmi</i>, owing to a failure to distinguish
Menaechmus I from his brother, his father-in-law and a physician
consider him insane and make arrangements, in his hearing,
for his apprehension. Notwithstanding, when they both leave
the stage at vs. 956 he makes no attempt to escape—an act
which would transfer the next two scenes elsewhere—but unconcernedly
awaits developments.</p>

<p>Finally I may mention one especially amusing artifice. In
Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i>, Orestes has left the
scene and is now supposed to be some distance away. Notwithstanding,
Athena addresses him and apologetically adds:
“For, though absent, you can hear my voice, since I am a
goddess” (vs. 1447). The same situation recurs, without
apology, at vs. 1462 and in Euripides’ <i>Helen</i>, vss. 1662 ff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>Likewise, the unity of time arose, not from the whim of
ancient writers, but from the same theatrical arrangements which
resulted in the unity of place, viz., the absence of a drop curtain
and the continuous presence of the chorus. Under these conditions
an intermission for the imaginary lapse of time could be
secured only by the withdrawal of the chorus, and without such
intermissions the constant and long-continued presence of the
same persons in the same place without food or slumber was in
danger of becoming an absurdity. Now we have seen how
difficult it was to invent motives for the successive reappearances
of actors; to motivate the movements of a body of twelve (fifteen)
tragic or twenty-four comic choreutae was naturally still more
difficult (see <a href="#Page_229">pp. 229-33</a> and <a href="#Page_150">150-52</a>, above). Consequently the
chorus is rarely removed from the stage during the action. Two
instances have already been mentioned (<a href="#Page_247">p. 247</a>, above). In the
<i>Ajax</i> advantage is taken of the withdrawal to change the scene
slightly; naturally a slight interval of time is also supposed to
elapse, but in this instance this is negligible and without significance.
In the <i>Eumenides</i> the case is different. Here the
scene is not shifted a few rods merely but from Delphi clear to
Athens. As the crow flies this was a distance of about eighty
miles and, in view of the physical conditions and ancient methods
of travel, would require two or three days to traverse. Accordingly
a considerable lacuna in the dramatic time of the play
must be assumed. What is still more remarkable is that, except
for the empty stage, the spectators are given nothing to help
“digest the abuse of distance.” At vs. 80 Apollo dispatches
Orestes to the city of Pallas, at vs. 179 he begins to drive the
chorus of Furies from his shrine, at vs. 234 he leaves the stage
and the scene is empty. Up to this point we are still at Delphi.
In the very next verse (235) Orestes rushes into the theater and
exclaims, “O queen Athena, I come at the bidding of Loxias.”
He has reached Athens! In Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i> the chorus forms
part of the queen’s funeral cortège and is absent during vss.
747-860. Although it is not usually so regarded I am inclined
to think that there is a slight change of scene here (see <a href="#Page_235">p. 235</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
above); there is also a slight condensation of time, but neither
constitutes a serious violation of these unities. This is one of the
rare cases where the withdrawal of the chorus resulted naturally
from the normal development of the plot. For if the choreutae
had been present when Heracles announced his intention of
rescuing Alcestis from death (vss. 840 ff.) the poet must have
invented a reason for their not reporting this news to Admetus
or have spoiled certain features of the finale. It was much
simpler to avoid the difficulty by allowing the chorus to do the
natural thing. In the following instances apparently no change
of scene or undue compression of time is involved. In Euripides’
<i>Helen</i> (vs. 385) the chorus accompany their mistress inside the
palace to consult the seeress Theonoe and re-enter at vs. 515.
The only advantage that seems to accrue from this maneuver
is to prolong Menelaus’ uncertainty as to the identity of his
newly recovered wife. In Aristophanes’ <i>Women in Council</i>
(vs. 311) the women of the chorus, disguised as men, leave for
the assembly in order to vote the management of the state into
their own hands, returning at vs. 478. Unless the playwright
wished to have the assembly scene enacted before the audience
he had to withdraw the chorus. As it is their doings are reported
by a messenger (Chremes) in vss. 376 ff. In the pseudo-Euripidean
<i>Rhesus</i> the chorus is absent during vss. 565-674, being
sent in front of the camp to receive Dolon (cf. vss. 522 ff.). The
presence of Trojan guards would have prevented the intervening
scene between the Greek marauders, Odysseus and Diomedes.
It will be noted how few are the instances of the withdrawal
of the chorus in the extant plays and that the observance of the
unities figures in just half of them. In New Comedy the chorus
appeared only between acts (see <a href="#Page_145">p. 145</a>) and it would have been
feasible to assume a lacuna several times in each play. That
this was not done was probably due to the fact that the other
practice had become stereotyped and that concentration of
action resulted in greater unity of plot. Sometimes the stage
is left empty <i>before the entrance of the chorus</i> by the retirement of
all the actors on the scene either between the prologue and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
parodus or between monologues (or dialogues) in the prologue.
Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i> (vs. 77) furnishes an example of the former
and his <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i> (vs. 66) of the latter. So
far as I have observed such pauses are not made use of to
accelerate the time unduly.</p>

<p>Since it was not often possible to suspend the audience’s
sense of time by removing the chorus, the poets had recourse
to the next best expedient, the choral odes. Inasmuch as several
of these occurred in every play, this artifice was far more available
than the other. In many respects the chorus moved upon a
different plane from the actors, and we are now dealing with one
of these differences. As Professor Butcher expressed it: “The
interval covered by a choral ode is one whose value is just what
the poet chooses to make it. While the time occupied by the
dialogue has a relation more or less exact to real time, the choral
lyrics suspend the outward action of the play and carry us still
farther away from the world of reality. What happens in the
interval cannot be measured by any ordinary reckoning; it is
much or little as the needs of the piece demand. A change of
place directly obtrudes itself on the senses, but time is only what
it appears to the mind. The imagination travels easily over
many hours; and in the Greek drama the time that elapses during
the songs of the chorus is entirely idealized” (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 293).
Thus the choral songs were roughly equivalent to the modern
intermission, and after them the action is often farther advanced
than the actual time required for chanting them would warrant.
For example, during a single stasimon of Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i>
(vss. 524-99) the Argive king must leave the scene, summon his
subjects to public assembly, state the object of the meeting, and
allow discussion before the final vote—all in time for Danaus to
report the people’s decision at the beginning of the following
episode! An analogy to ancient practice occurs in Shakespeare’s
<i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, where Time as Chorus announces the passage
of sixteen years between Acts III and IV.</p>

<p>But at the same time that the chorus conferred this liberty
it restricted it. The presence of such a body of performers at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
all the scenes of a play could seldom be entirely natural. Yet
that the same persons should be found standing about, in the
same place, at various intervals during the day is conceivable,
though it does not often happen. But that they should be found
there at every moment chosen for representation during weeks
or months or years is inconceivable and ridiculous. Only by
shortening the supposed action of the piece and the supposed
lacunae in the plot could the convention be tolerated at all.
However, Professor Verrall was lacking in historical imagination
when he maintained that “the point at which the discrepancy
between the facts presented and the natural facts began to be
flagrant and intolerable was when the audience were told to
pass in imagination <i>from day to day</i>. Night is the great natural
interrupter of actions and changer of situations” (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 1).
To the spoiled theatergoer of today this would seem to be true.
But the ancient drama knew no lighting effects (see <a href="#Page_224">p. 224</a>, above).
On the stage day and night looked the same to them. Scenes
at midday, in the darkness of night, in the gloom of Hades, were
alike enacted in the glare of the sun. Ostensibly the entire
action of the anonymous <i>Rhesus</i> and much of that in Euripides’
<i>Cyclops</i> fell within the hours of night, and characters frequently
addressed the heavenly constellations in (actual) daylight. So
far were the playwrights from avoiding the discrepancy involved
in passing from one day to another that in Terence’s translation
of Menander’s <i>Self-Tormentor</i>, when a night is supposed to
elapse between Acts II and III, attention is deliberately called
to it by Chremes’ words, “It is beginning to grow light here
now” (vs. 410). In my opinion this play extends over about as
much time as the conditions which obtained in ancient drama
would normally allow; and it should be noted that it does not
exceed the twenty-four hours permitted by the unity of time.</p>

<p>In the third place, perhaps it is unnecessary to point out that
acceleration of time is possible in all drama quite apart from an
empty stage or choral songs. Instances can be cited even from
dramatists who owned no allegiance to the unities—note, for
example, the striking of the half-hour every twenty or twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
lines at the close of Marlowe’s <i>Doctor Faustus</i>. In Aristophanes’
<i>Plutus</i> the blind god is escorted from the stage for a night’s
treatment in the temple of Asclepius (vs. 626), the chorus remaining
in its place but apparently not singing.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> At the very next
verse one of the escort returns to announce that Plutus has
recovered his sight and to relate the events of the night! But
here again, despite the transition from one day to another, the
action does not exceed twenty-four hours. In the same writer’s
<i>Acharnians</i>, Amphitheus goes from Athens to Sparta and returns
again during the dialogue contained between vss. 133 and 174.
There is no hint, however, that his reappearance is premature or
that his trip would occupy more than the apparent space
allotted it.</p>

<p>But neither the ordinary acceleration of time in drama nor
the use of stasima nor yet the stage left empty by the retirement
of chorus and actors tells the whole story of Greek practice.
Nowadays the playbill clearly informs us how much time has
elapsed between acts, and the piece is constructed accordingly.
If a character in the third act has occasion to refer to something
which occurred in the first act ten years or so ago he must not
speak of it as if it happened yesterday. Not so in ancient drama.
The Greek audiences had no playbills, and even the introductions
to Greek plays prepared by Alexandrian scholars contained no
such information as this. I fancy that the Greek dramatist
never laid his finger upon a given line and said: “Here we must
assume a lapse of several days, or months, or years.” The
events of a drama, regardless of actualities, were conventionally
treated as occupying no more than twenty-four hours. A like
convention was customary in the Greek epic: when once a
Homeric character was given a definite age or form he maintained
each unchanged throughout.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> For example, Telemachus
is introduced in the first book of the <i>Odyssey</i> as a young man just
reaching his majority, ready and anxious to assume the duties of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
manhood; but nine years before, when he could not have been
more than twelve years of age, he is spoken of as just as old and
as already a man among men (cf. Book xi, vss. 185 f. and 449).
Again, in the third book of the <i>Iliad</i>, Helen is pictured in the
prime of youth and beauty; ten years later and thirty years
after her elopement with Paris she is likened to the same goddess
as is the Maiden Nausicaa (cf. <i>Odyssey</i> iv. 121 f. and vi. 102 ff.).
In Greek drama time relations are similarly ignored. At the
opening of Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i> the watchman sights the
signal fire which announces the capture of Troy, and within a
few hundred lines Agamemnon has finished the sack, traversed
the Aegean, and appeared before his palace! No hint is given,
however, that there is anything unusual about all this; not a
word<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> indicates that the action is disconnected at any point.</p>

<p>This is the most flagrant instance, and I conceive that it is
to be interpreted as follows: The performance of Greek drama
in the fifth century was continuous in the sense that with negligible
exceptions (see <a href="#Page_250">pp. 250 f.</a>, above) actors or chorus or both
were constantly before the audience. Notice that this is not
the same as saying that the <i>time</i> of the plays was continuous.
When critically examined it is found to have been interrupted
by numerous gaps, as we have already seen and shall see again.
But the continuity of performance gave a <i>semblance</i> of continuity
also to the action. Therefore when a modern playwright like
Pinero restricts his action to one day and represents the lapse
of several hours by the fall of the curtain between acts, he does
not thereby observe the unity of time in the Greek sense. The
dramatic events were tacitly treated by the poets as if they
occupied no more than a day and were so accepted by the public.
By “tacitly” I mean that if such crowding involved a physical
or moral impossibility the dramatists never stooped to apologize
or explain but placed their events in juxtaposition just the same.
In Plautus’ <i>Captives</i>, Philocrates travels from Aetolia (the scene
of action) to Elis and back again between vss. 460 and 768. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
real life such a trip would have required several days, but in the
play it consumes less than one! Do we positively know this?
Beyond the shadow of a doubt. A parasite is introduced at
intervals during the play scheming to be invited to a meal.
He is first seen at vs. 69 and does not get a satisfactory invitation
until vs. 897. A more detailed statement would show conclusively
that the same day’s meal is under discussion throughout.
Moreover, this is no mere <i>lapsus calami</i>, such as a few phrases
which are found in an opposite sense,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> but is unmistakable in its
import and is closely interwoven with the plot. If anyone feels
amazed at so deliberate a contradiction he may console himself
with a study of the use of “double time” in Shakespeare. It
would be possible, but is quite unnecessary, to cite other plays
in which restriction of time to a single day is indicated with
sufficient exactness. Of course the Greek dramatists did not
consistently introduce references to the precise date or to the
time of day. In general they were wise enough to act upon the
principle which Corneille<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> expressed as follows: “Above all I
would leave the length of the action to the imagination of the
hearers, and never determine the time, if the subject does not
require it.... What need is there to mark at the opening
of the play that the sun is rising, that it is noon at the third
act, and sunset at the end of the last?”</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that Professor Verrall, who fully
recognized the dependence of this unity upon local conditions
and published eminently sensible observations on the subject,
nevertheless felt constrained to challenge the obvious interpretation
of two plays in which a glaring violation of the unity of
time occurs. In the <i>Agamemnon</i> he supposed the watchman and
the populace (including the chorus) to be misinformed as to the
meaning of the beacon and that it really served to Clytemnestra,
Aegisthus, and their supporters as a warning of Agamemnon’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
being close at hand! His elucidation of Euripides’ <i>Andromache</i>
was still more ingenious and complicated.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> But to bolster up
such interpretations Mr. Verrall ought to have explained away
all similar instances as well—to explain, for example, how in
Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i> an Attic army can march from Eleusis to
the vicinity of Thebes and fight a battle there, and how tidings
of the victory can be brought back to Eleusis, all between vss.
598 and 634, which, as Dryden<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> expressed it, “is not for every
mile a verse.” Nevertheless not the slightest attention is paid
to such patent impossibilities, and in every case the whole action
is unmistakably supposed to fall within a day.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing it is not surprising that Aristotle
does mention the unity of time, though only incidentally. His
exact language is: “Tragedy and epic differ, again, in their
length: for tragedy endeavors, so far as possible, to keep within
a single circuit of the sun (περίοδος ἡλίου), or but slightly to
exceed this limit; whereas the epic action has no limits of time.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
“Endeavors” (πειρᾶται) was mistranslated as <i>doit</i> by some
French writers. Aristotle rather commends the unity of time
as a rough generalization which works out well in practice than
enjoins it as an invariable rule. Actually the restriction was
further reduced, in most cases, to the hours of daylight, and
Dacier even maintained that περίοδος ἡλίου means no more than
twelve hours. But Aristophanes’ <i>Plutus</i> and Terence’s <i>Self-Tormentor</i>
(see <a href="#Page_253">pp. 253</a>, above) furnish clear examples of dramatic
action beginning in the late afternoon of one day and not
concluding until the next day.</p>

<p>It remains to consider some of the expedients which the poets
found useful in solving the difficulties (both of time and place)
caused by local conditions. In the first place the practice of
writing a series of three plays on the same general subject (see
<a href="#Page_198">p. 198</a>, above) often enabled the playwright to distribute his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
incidents in different places and time-spheres without loss of
verisimilitude, for a whole trilogy was no longer than the average
modern play, and each tragedy would thus correspond to a single
act and, since the chorus was withdrawn at the close of each play
in the trilogy and its place taken by another entirely different,
changes of time and place between plays were absolutely without
restriction. Thus Scythia of Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus Bound</i> becomes
Caucasus in the second piece in the trilogy, the <i>Prometheus
Unbound</i>; in the former was shown the binding of the
Titan and in the latter his release, and he is said to have been
bound for 30,000 years. All but two days of this time elapses
between plays! In Aeschylus’ Orestean trilogy the scene of the
<i>Agamemnon</i> and <i>Libation-Bearers</i> is laid in Argos; that of the
<i>Eumenides</i> in Delphi and Athens. Several years are supposed
to pass by in the two interims.</p>

<p>But even Aeschylus did not always employ the trilogic form,
and Sophocles and Euripides rarely did. When, therefore, the
three or four plays in each series were severally devoted to utterly
unrelated material, it sometimes became necessary to bring
almost as many events within the scope of one play as would
otherwise be dealt with in a whole trilogy. Inasmuch as a large
fraction of these events could not possibly be conceived of as
taking place in the same locality or within the same day, it was
imperative either to exclude them or to include them in some
indirect fashion. Now two striking peculiarities of Euripidean
technique were admirably adapted to help solve these difficulties.
His prologues regularly take the form of a monologue, which,
with scant regard for dramatic illusion, rehearses the story of
the myth up to the point where the play begins. Again, Euripides’
dramas frequently terminate with the epiphany of a
deity. This device was the accustomed recourse of unskilful
playwrights, when their plots had become complicated beyond
the possibility of disentanglement by natural means, in order
that a god’s fiat might resolve all difficulties. It has often been
charged that this was also Euripides’ motive, but most unjustly
(see <a href="#Page_293">pp. 293 ff.</a>, below). He rather “wished, by the help of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
divine foreknowledge, to put before the spectators such future
events or unknown circumstances as should settle their minds,
satisfy all curiosity, and connect the subject of the piece with
subsequent events or even with the times of living men.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
Thus in Euripides’ <i>Andromache</i> the complications of the plot are
entirely solved before Thetis’ appearance at vs. 1231, and she
merely gives directions for Neoptolemus’ burial and prophesies
the future of Peleus, Andromache, and Molossus, and of the
latter’s posterity. When these two pieces of technique were
combined in the same play, the prologue, the body of the tragedy,
and the epilogue sometimes corresponded roughly to the successive
dramas of a whole trilogy. This appears most clearly
in the case of Euripides’ <i>Electra</i> and Aeschylus’ Orestean trilogy.
The opening monologue of the former (vss. 1-53) passes in
rapid review the Greek expedition against Troy, the murder
of Agamemnon, and the present fate of his children. With the
exception of the last item, which is brought out in the second
play of the <i>Oresteia</i>, these are the matters contained in the prologue,
which naturally is comparatively short, and in the action
of Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i>. The body of the <i>Electra</i> corresponds
to the second tragedy in the trilogy, the <i>Libation-Bearers</i>. At
the <i>Electra’s</i> conclusion (vs. 1238) Castor as <i>deus ex machina</i>
forecasts among other things the acquittal of Orestes at Athens,
which is the theme of Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i>. Whatever other
explanations, therefore, may be advanced for Euripides’ prologues
and epilogues (see <a href="#Page_294">pp. 294 f.</a> and <a href="#Page_299">299 f.</a>, below) this
consideration must also be allowed a certain weight, viz., that
they permitted him to bring events of the most diverse nature
within the scope of his piece without violating the unities of time
and place.</p>

<p>A fourth device looking to the same ends consisted in setting
conversations at times and places which would naturally be
different. Even such a master of dramatic technique as
Sophocles represented Orestes as communicating to his fellow-conspirators
the result of his inquiry at Delphi only after they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
had reached Argos (<i>Electra</i>, vss. 32 ff.), and as waiting to formulate
a definite plan of action until they were in the most
unfavorable place in all the world for such a purpose—before
Clytemnestra’s palace (vss. 15 ff.). The latter incongruity does
not occur in Euripides’ version of the same story because the
scene of his <i>Electra</i> is laid, not in the city of Argos, but before
Electra’s hut in the country. The device under consideration
was conveniently supplemented by the convention that if two
or more characters enter the stage together no conversation is
thought of as passing between them until they have come within
the hearing of the audience (see <a href="#Page_310">p. 310</a>, below). It will be seen
that the passage just cited from Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i> conforms to
this rule. Another instance occurs in Euripides’ <i>Madness of
Heracles</i>, vss. 822 ff. Iris appears above Heracles’ palace with
Madness, whom she orders to incite the hero to the murder of his
children. Madness protests but is overborne and forced to
perform her bidding. Though Iris and Madness must have
come a considerable distance together, all discourse between
them is apparently postponed until they reach their destination.
Furthermore, these instructions would naturally have been given
to Madness elsewhere and somewhat earlier. In that case the
audience must have lost an effective scene. The device discussed
in this paragraph enabled the poet to circumvent the
unities and place the scene before his audience; and the convention
which I have mentioned preserved it for them in its
entirety.</p>

<p>We have seen that the unities of time and place are largely due
to the striving for illusion in a theater comparatively bare of
scenery and of facilities for scene-shifting. Conversely, their
observance in the modern theater with its ample scenic provision
would naturally militate against the scenic extravagance and
actualism of which the present-day theatocracy is so enamored.
Thus it would seem that the much-abused unities are not
without a meaning and truly artistic tendency even today, for
some of the most significant influences in contemporaneous
staging are directed against excesses along these lines. Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
a modern producer, Henry W. Savage, included the following
in his advice to a young playwright: “Do not distribute your
scenes so widely that you have one on an island, another at
Herald Square, and a third at Chicago. Make the action of your
play take place all in one day, if possible”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>—in other words
the unity of time expressly and an approximation to the unity
of place. Ibsen surely retained no theatrical conventions merely
because they were old; yet he usually observed the unities.
A recent critic has written: “Though the unities of time and
place were long ago exploded as binding principles—indeed, they
never had any authority in English drama—yet it is true that a
broken-backed action, whether in time or space, ought, so far as
possible, to be avoided. An action with a gap of twenty years
in it may be all very well in melodrama and romance, but scarcely
in higher and more serious types of drama.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>The unity of action is the only one that is universal, since it
alone springs from the inmost nature of the drama. Yet even
here local conditions make themselves felt. The modern playwright,
free (if he pleases and has a producer complaisant
enough) to change the scene ten times within a single act and
with superior facilities for motivating entrances and exits,
delights in shifting different sets of characters back and forth
and thus secures an alternation of light and shade, an intermingling
of comedy and tragedy quite beyond the ancient
dramatist’s reach. The preceding discussion has shown the
immobility of the ancient theater in these respects and, consequently,
one reason why the Greeks ruthlessly excluded everything
that was not strictly germane to their action (see also
<a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>, above).</p>

<p>This unity, it is needless to say, plays an important part in
Aristotle’s <i>Poetics</i>. He recognized that “plot is the first essential
and soul of tragedy and that character comes second.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> The
most lengthy statement runs as follows: “Let us now discuss
the proper construction of the plot, as that is both the first and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
the most important thing in tragedy. We have laid it down that
tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete and whole,
having a certain magnitude, for there is also a whole that is
wanting in magnitude. Now a whole is that which has a
beginning, a middle, and an end. A beginning is that which is
not itself necessarily after anything else and after which something
else naturally is or comes to be; an end, on the contrary,
is that which itself naturally follows some other thing either as its
necessary or usual consequent, and has nothing else after it;
and a middle is that which is both itself after one thing and has
some other thing after it. Accordingly, well-constructed plots
must neither begin nor end at haphazard points, but must
conform to the types just mentioned.”<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> These principles were
excellently restated by Lowell:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In a play we not only expect a succession of scenes, but that each
scene should lead by a logic more or less stringent, if not to the next, at
any rate to something that is to follow, and that all should contribute their
fraction of impulse towards the inevitable catastrophe. That is to say, the
structure should be organic, with a necessary and harmonious connection
and relation of parts, and not merely mechanical with an arbitrary or haphazard
joining of one part to another. It is in the former sense alone that
any production can be called a work of art.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Though it is now admitted on all sides that the unity of
action is the <i>sine qua non</i> of dramatic composition, many fail to
realize the meaning and extent of its limitation. Aristotle
indicated a mistaken notion current in his day, and likewise in
ours, in the following words: “The unity of a plot does not
consist, as some suppose, in its having one man as its subject.
An infinite multitude of things befall that one man, some of
which it is impossible to reduce to unity, and so, too, there are
many actions of one man which cannot be made to form one
action. Hence, the error, as it appears, of all the poets who have
composed a <i>Heracleid</i>, a <i>Theseid</i>, or similar poems. They suppose
that, because Heracles was one man, the story also of
Heracles must be one story.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Freytag discussed the matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
with keen discrimination and exemplified it by showing how
Shakespeare remodeled the more or less chaotic story of Romeo
and Juliet’s love into a unified plot whose incidents follow one
another almost as inexorably as Fate. The passage is unfortunately
too long for quotation here, but is highly instructive.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>The same reasoning reveals the shortcoming in Professor
Lounsbury’s contention: “What, indeed, is the objection to this
mixture of the serious and the comic in the same play? By it is
certainly represented, as it is not in pure comedy or pure tragedy,
the life we actually live and the mingled elements that compose
it.... As there was no question that sadness and mirth were
constantly intermixed in real life, it was impossible to maintain
that the illegitimacy of this form of dramatic composition was
due to its improbability.”<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The word “pure” gives away the
whole case. Aristotle would have to grant that Shakespeare’s
plays are admirable, even sublime; but he could hardly admit
that they were “pure” tragedies or “pure” comedies, however
legitimate in other respects. They fall short in the quality
which Mr. Albert H. Brown placed in the forefront of his definition:
“A great drama is a <i>clearly focused</i> picture of human
conditions.”</p>

<p>Aristotle also pointed out that epic poetry has an advantage
in that it can present many events simultaneously transacted,
while the drama is restricted to but one.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> A curious violation
of this self-evident principle occurred in a recent American play.
Toward the end of Act II in Eugene Walter’s <i>Paid in Full</i>,
Emma Brooks is disclosed making an appointment with Captain
Williams over the telephone. In the next act we are transferred
to Captain Williams’ quarters, and the dramatic clock has in
the meanwhile been turned back some fifteen minutes, for
presently the telephone bell rings and the same appointment is
made over again. In other words, Act III partially overlaps
Act II in time, but the scene is different. It can scarcely be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
denied that the dramatic situation has been enhanced by this
device, but this gain has been secured at the sacrifice of verisimilitude
and dramatic illusion. Such “cut-backs” may be all
very well in moving pictures, but they hardly have a place in
spoken drama.</p>

<p>Thus, the Greek masters were so far from evolving unities
out of their inner consciousness or from observing them invariably
that they constantly violated the unities of time and place
in both letter and spirit. Their practice throughout simply
reacted to theatrical conditions as they found them. It has
remained for their successors, whose theater has for the most part
been quite dissimilar, to observe the unities with a literalness
and exactness such as never characterized the great dramatists
of Greece. That both ancients and moderns have produced
masterpieces under these restrictions is, of course, beyond dispute.
In fact, some of our most impressive plays of recent date
such as Kennedy’s <i>Servant in the House</i>, have conformed to them.
That many modern plays would have been improved by observing
them is doubtless also true. Even so uncompromising an
admirer of Shakespeare as Professor Lounsbury<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Let it not be imagined, however, that any attempt is made here to deny
the merit of modern plays which observe the unities, or to maintain that a
powerful drama cannot be produced upon the lines they prescribe. Such
a contention would be only repeating on the side of the opponents of this
doctrine the erroneous assumptions which its advocates put forth. He who
ventures to take a position so extreme can hardly escape a feeling of serious
discomfort if called upon, in consequence, to decry the productions of
Corneille, Racine, and Molière, to say nothing of some of the most brilliant
pieces which have adorned the English stage. Nor, furthermore, need it
be denied that there are conditions in which the observance of the unities
may be a positive advantage. Especially will this be the case when the
characters are few and all the incidents of the plot are directed to the
accomplishment of a single result. The concentration of the action is likely
to contribute, in such pieces, to the effect of the representation. He who
sets out to imitate the simplicity of the Greek drama will usually find himself
disposed to adopt, as far as possible, its form. Within its limitations
great work can be accomplished by the drama which regards the unities,
and, to some extent, it will be great work because of its limitations.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">But that the unities should be arbitrarily imposed upon every
drama without exception is absurd, since the theatrical conditions
that called them forth are no longer the same. That Aeschylus
and Sophocles, if present with us in the flesh, would avail
themselves of the greater flexibility and adaptability of the
modern theater I cannot doubt. At any rate that restless spirit,
Euripides, would certainly have gloried in its freedom.</p>

<p>As a cumulative result of the conditions already described
the action of a Greek drama was restricted to the culmination
alone, corresponding to the fifth act of most modern plays.
Though we have seen that the Greek poets arbitrarily juxtaposed,
as if within the confines of a sun’s circuit, events which were
actually separated by considerable intervals, yet even the
widest license would hardly permit a whole series of transactions,
of sufficient dignity and importance to be chosen for tragic
representation, to be compressed within a single day and limited
to a single spot. As Dryden<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> expressed it, the ancient playwrights
“set the audience, as it were, at the post where the race
is to be concluded; and, saving them the tedious expectation of
seeing the poet set out and ride the beginning of the course, they
suffer you not to behold him, till he is in sight of the goal, and
just upon you.” Thus in Aeschylus’ <i>Suppliants</i> we see nothing
of the unwelcome suit of Aegyptus’ sons and of the events which
led the daughters of Danaus to take refuge in flight. All this
lies in the past and is brought before us indirectly. The action
begins when the Danaids have reached another land and are on
the point of being overtaken by their cousins. Similarly, in
Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i> we learn by hearsay the long story of Apollo’s
servitude at the court of Admetus, of his providing a way of
escape from death for the king, and of the latter’s disheartening
search for a substitute. Only the final stage in the action, the
day of the queen’s self-immolation and rescue, is chosen for
actual representation. The same situation recurs in almost
every piece. Of course in trilogies it was possible to select
three different time-spheres and three different localities for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
dramatic action. But here again only the crests of three crises in
the story were put before the spectators’ eyes; all the rest was
narrated. So invariable a method of attack would seem monotonous
to us today, but its successful employment by Ibsen and
many another in modern times proves that there is nothing
blameworthy in the practice per se.</p>

<p>Finally, since the dramatic action was confined to a single
day (however elastic) at the culmination of the story, it was rarely
possible for the dramatis personae to experience any particular
change or development of character during the course of the
play. This fixity of type was not only a natural result of theatrical
conditions in ancient times and of the use of masks but was
also in thorough accord with Homeric conventions (see <a href="#Page_254">pp. 254 f.</a>,
above). Moreover, it harmonized completely with the Greek
fondness for schematization. Horace’s words in his <i>Ars Poetica</i>
are entirely Hellenic in spirit: “Either follow tradition, or
invent that which shall be self-consistent. In the former case,
let Achilles be impatient, irascible, ruthless, keen...; let
Medea be untamed and unconquerable, Ino tearful, Ixion treacherous,
Io ever roving, and Orestes in sorry plight. In the latter
case, keep the character to the end of the play as it was at the
beginning and let it be consistent” (vss. 119 ff.). All this implies
more than we would think desirable today. Not only was a
positive development into a character seemingly inharmonious
with that seen at first rarely possible, but the singleness of purpose
in ancient plays, which has been called the unity of mood
(see <a href="#Page_201">p. 201</a>, above), crowded out incidents which might have
revealed other phases, no matter how consistent, of a dramatic
personage’s character. The taste of some critics objected to even
the slight modifications in rôle which ancient conditions did
permit. For example, to modern readers the manner in which
Medea, in Euripides’ tragedy of that name, wavers between love
for her children and the desire to punish her recreant husband by
murdering them is esteemed one of the finest touches in ancient
drama. But the Greek argument which is prefixed to this play
reports that “they blame Euripides because he did not maintain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
Medea’s rôle but allowed her to burst into tears as she plotted
against Jason and his second wife.” Again, so excellent a critic
as Aristotle cites the title rôle in Euripides’ <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i> as
an example of inconsistency,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> inasmuch as the Iphigenia who
pleads for her life at vss. 1211 ff. in no wise resembles her later self,
who willingly approaches the altar. To modern feeling, since the
change is psychologically possible and is plausibly motived by
the sudden realization that her death can serve her country, it
seems entirely unobjectionable. But these two passages and the
usual practice of the Greek stage reveal a discrepancy between
the ancient and the modern points of view. The simplicity of
character-drawing which resulted from Greek methods is
strikingly described, in a different connection, by Mr. Cornford:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Agamemnon, for instance, is simply Hybris typified in a legendary
person. He is a hero flown with “insolence” (the pride and elation of
victory), and that is all that can be said of him. He is not, like a character
in Ibsen, a complete human being with a complex personality, a center
from which relations radiate to innumerable points of contact in a universe
of indifferent fact. He has not a continuous history: nothing has ever
happened to him except the conquest of Troy and the sacrifice of Iphigenia;
nothing ever could happen to him except Pride’s fall and the stroke of the
axe. As we see him he is not a man, but a single state of mind, which has
never been preceded by other states of mind (except one, at the sacrifice in
Aulis), but is isolated, without context, margin, or atmosphere. Every
word he says, in so far as he speaks for himself and not for the poet, comes
straight out of that state of mind and expresses some phase of it. He has a
definite relation to Cassandra, a definite relation to Clytemnestra; but no
relation to anything else. If he can be said to have a <i>character</i> at all it consists
solely of certain defects which make him liable to Insolence; if he has
any <i>circumstances</i>, they are only those which prompt him to his besetting
passion.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to state that the differences between ancient
life in Greece and modern life in America and Western Europe
are endless. To attempt to enumerate them all would require
a separate volume. In the present chapter I shall undertake
to touch upon some of the features which more intimately
affected Greek drama.</p>

<p>First of all a modern can scarcely avoid a feeling of surprise
that plays were almost always brought out in competition; but
no instinct was more thoroughly imbedded in the Greek consciousness
than this. From the time of the first celebration of
the Olympian games in 776 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> or before, a contest of some kind
formed, to their minds, the most natural setting for the display
of athletic, musical, and literary skill. Associated with this
fact was another, viz., that the prizes awarded upon these
occasions were usually more honorific than intrinsically valuable.
The victors in the Olympian games received a garland of wild
olive and a palm branch. It is true that the delighted fellow-citizens
of the victors usually supplemented the award by something
more substantial, but the fact remains that these trivial
objects were the sole official reward for many arduous months of
preparation and training. In like manner we are informed by
the most ancient tradition that the original prize in tragic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
contests was a goat (see <a href="#Page_13">p. 13 f.</a> above); and what is more, it is
said to have been customary for the victorious poet to offer up
his prize in immediate sacrifice to the god of the festival. After
the reorganization of the City Dionysia about 501 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, however,
it seems likely that pecuniary awards were established for the
tragic victors. Though we are in ignorance as to their amount,
some notion can be formed from the fact that prizes of ten, eight,
and six minae,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> respectively, were granted dithyrambic victors
at the Piraeus festival toward the close of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
Three prizes seem to have been available in tragedy at the City
Dionysia also, so that every contestant was sure of some
compensation. In other words, to be chosen to compete at all
was sufficient honor to entitle even the poorest of the three to a
suitable reward. Only the winner of the first prize, however,
was technically regarded as “victor.” In comedy, according to
tradition, the original prize was a jar of wine, which likewise
gave place to financial awards after comedy came under state
control at the City Dionysia of 486 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> These arrangements
were extended to the Lenaea, when first comedy and then
tragedy were introduced there (see <a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>, above), and to contests
between actors, as these were established at the two festivals
(see <a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>, above). The successful playwrights, actors, and
“choregi” (see below) seem to have been crowned with garlands
of ivy by the presiding archon—the archon eponymus at the
City Dionysia and the king archon at the Lenaea.</p>

<p>In several particulars the government under which the
Athenians lived was indirect in its provisions. For example,
though valuable mines belonged to the state, they were not
worked by government officials but were leased to private
parties. Accordingly, although the dramatic festivals were
under the direct control of the state, the financial management
was relegated to lessees, who agreed to keep the theater in repair
and to pay a stipulated sum into the public treasury in return for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
the privilege of collecting an admission fee. During the fourth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the lessees of the Piraeus theater paid thirty-three
minae annually. This system explains why the authorities,
when they wished to enable even the poorest citizens to attend
the dramatic exhibitions, did not simply throw open the doors to
all or issue passes. Instead, toward the end of the fifth century
it was provided that any citizen might receive two obols from
the “theoric” fund in order to pay his own way into the day’s
performances (see <a href="#Page_120">p. 120</a>, above).</p>

<p>Another instance of the indirect exercise of governmental
functions is seen in the practice of various kinds of “public
service” (λειτουργία). Thus when the Board of Generals had
provided the hull of a warship (“trireme”) they did not proceed
also to rig it and to hire a commander. Instead some rich
citizen was required to contribute toward its rigging and upkeep
and to command it for one year. This obligation was laid upon
the wealthier citizens in rotation; and if anyone considered that
he was being called upon too frequently or that someone of
greater substance was escaping his just responsibilities, he could
challenge him to an exchange of property (ἀντίδοσις). According
to law the man so challenged was restricted to the two options
of either assuming the burden or trading estates. This system
of liturgies applied to the maintenance not only of the naval
service but also of dramatic and dithyrambic contests, the torch
race, etc. It was provided that no one need act as trierarch
more frequently than once in three years, bear any liturgy two
successive years, or two liturgies in the same year. But it was
the glory of Athenian citizenship that they served oftener and
spent their means more generously than the law demanded.
The bearers of the theatrical liturgies were called <i>choregi</i>
(χορηγοί), and there was no surer method of displaying one’s
wealth and of currying favor with the populace than by voluntary
and lavish assumption of the choregia. The evidence is not
sufficient to establish just how the charges were distributed.
The state seems to have paid the actors, and the choregus to
have been responsible for assembling and hiring a body of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
choreutae, engaging a trainer to drill them, purchasing or renting
costumes for the chorus, employing mute characters, providing
showy extras of various kinds, etc. As regards the flute-player
a distinction was perhaps drawn between the dithyrambic and
dramatic contests, the state employing him in the former and the
choregus in the latter. The question of an additional actor has
already been discussed (see <a href="#Page_172">pp. 172-82</a>, above). A speaker in
one of Lysias’ orations<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> claims to have spent, within a period of
seven years, thirty minae for a tragic choregia, sixteen minae for
one in comedy, fifty minae for a dithyrambic chorus of men, fifteen
minae for a chorus of boys, three hundred and sixty minae
for six trierarchies, twelve minae as gymnasiarch, etc. Since this
man’s ambition led him to do more than his share, these outlays
are probably somewhat larger than they need to have been;
in fact, he declares that the law would not have required of him
one-fourth as much. But in addition to indicating how much
some were willing to spend, the figures are valuable also as
showing the comparative expense of the different events. Needless
to state, a poet’s chance of victory was considerably affected
by the wealth and disposition of his choregus. An ambitious
and lavish man like Nicias, who is declared by Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> never
to have been worsted in any of his numerous choregias, could
manifestly do much to retrieve a poor play. But woe betide the
playwright whose success was largely in the keeping of a sponsor
who would spend no more than law and public opinion could
wring from him. In 405 and 404 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, while Athens was experiencing
a financial stringency just before the close of the Peloponnesian
War, the number of choregi at the City Dionysia was
temporarily doubled, so that two synchoregi might divide between
them the burden which normally fell to one man. Finally
about 308 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the dearth of rich men caused the abandonment
of the choregic system and the annual appointment of an
<i>agonothete</i> (ἀγωνοθέτης) or “master of contests,” whose own resources
were supplemented by a state subsidy and who assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
entire control and financial responsibility for all the dithyrambic
and dramatic contests at the festival.</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic features of the Athenian
democracy was the large rôle assigned to the lot in the selection
of officials. For example, in Aristotle’s day the nine archons
were chosen by lot from five hundred men, who had themselves
been previously chosen by lot, fifty from each of the ten tribes.
Whatever may have been the other objects of this system, at
least one was the prevention of bribery and manipulation; and
without a doubt this was the motive which led to the use of the
lot in theatrical matters. Thus the judges in the contests seem,
though the scheme is largely conjectural and depends upon
insufficient notices, to have been selected and to have rendered
decisions somewhat as follows: Some days before the festival a
certain number of names was taken from each tribe and deposited
in ten sealed urns in the Acropolis. Just before the contest
began, these vessels were brought into the theater and the presiding
archon drew one name from each tribal urn. The men so
chosen came forward and swore to judge truly. When the
performances were over, each judge wrote down his verdict and
the ten ballots were placed in a single urn. The archon now
drew out half of these, which were alone used in arriving at the
ultimate decision! So cumbersome a system can be justified
only by its results; and it must be allowed that, so far as we can
now determine, no poet suffered any great injustice from its
operation. The playwrights usually won whom later critics
were unanimous in considering the greatest. Each of the tragic
triad wrote about one hundred plays: Aeschylus, whose career
fell before the admission of tragedy to the Lenaea, gained
thirteen victories at the City Dionysia; Sophocles, eighteen City
and at least two Lenaean victories; and Euripides, fifteen (or
possibly only five) victories at both festivals (see <a href="#Page_325">p. 325</a>, below).
It must be remembered that several plays would be simultaneously
crowned at each victory in tragedy (see <a href="#Page_198">p. 198</a>, above). The
most astounding reversal occurred when Philocles, Aeschylus’
mediocre nephew, defeated Sophocles’ didascalic group in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
was included his <i>Oedipus the King</i>, perhaps the greatest tragedy
of ancient times! However, this apparent lapse of judgment is
possibly to be explained by the factor mentioned in the last
paragraph, a parsimonious choregus.</p>

<p>The lot was employed also in another connection. Immediately
after the beginning of each civil year in Hecatombaeon
(July), the archon eponymus and the king archon attended to the
appointment of tragic choregi for the City Dionysia and the
Lenaean festival, respectively. During the fifth century they
chose the comic choregi as well, but Aristotle informs us that in
his day their selection was managed by the tribes.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> After this
detail had been arranged the archons proceeded to “grant a
chorus” to a suitable number of playwrights. For this purpose
doubtless an untried poet was required to submit a more or less
finished copy of what he wished to produce; from seasoned
writers probably the presentation of a scenario or even less was
deemed sufficient. At any rate Dr. Ruppel has shown that in
Aristophanes’ comedies the plot was sometimes essentially
modified by or even integrally depended upon events which took
place but a few weeks before the festival. It is evident that the
archons exercised considerable discretion in selecting the playwrights;
at least we are told that no less a personage than
Sophocles was once refused a chorus when one was granted to
an obscure Gnesippus.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> When poets and choregi had finally
been chosen, the troublesome task of matching them still confronted
the officials. Naturally the important consequences
which we have seen to grow out of the assignment of a generous
or niggardly choregus to a poet served only to enhance the
difficulty of the situation. And in the light of what has just
been said concerning the Athenian fondness for the lot, it is not
surprising that the problem was met by its use. After the actors
passed from private to public management, about 449 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
(see <a href="#Page_183">p. 183</a>, above), the lot was employed also to distribute the
protagonists among the dramatists. In the fourth century the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
more equitable system became possible of permitting each
protagonist to appear in a single one of each tragedian’s three
plays (see <a href="#Page_185">p. 185</a>, above).</p>

<p>One of the most prominent traits of the Greek, and especially
of the Athenian, character was litigiousness. Inasmuch as from
the time of Pericles citizens of Attica received a slight stipend
for serving upon juries, which ranged from 201 to 2,500 in
membership and sometimes reached an aggregate of 6,000,
there was scarcely an Athenian but was personally acquainted
with courtroom procedure and not a few practically supported
themselves in this way. Moreover, this situation was intensified
by the fact that the fifth century witnessed the rise of formal
oratory at Athens and its exploitation by numerous rhetorical
and sophistic teachers. It is hardly possible that all these
influences should have allowed contemporaneous drama to escape
unscathed. Their first effect is seen in the actual introduction
of a courtroom scene, as in Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i>, in which
Orestes is put on trial before the Council of the Areopagus for
having murdered his mother. Athena is the presiding judge,
Apollo the attorney for the defense, and the chorus of Furies
conducts the prosecution. Aristophanes satirized the Athenian
weakness in his <i>Wasps</i>, the chorus of which appeared in the guise
of those quarrelsome insects; and that inveterate juryman,
Philocleon, was provided with a domestic court wherein one dog
was duly arraigned by another for having pilfered a round of
Sicilian cheese! Again, certain scenes in other plays, though
not ostensibly placed in the courtroom, are practically treated
as if they were. For example, in Euripides’ <i>Trojan Women</i>,
Menelaus meets his truant wife for the first time since her elopement.
Will he pardon or slay her? Helen herself naturally
hopes to be forgiven and restored to her husband’s favor; but
the Trojan women, who hold her responsible for their country’s
downfall, wish condign punishment to be meted out to her.
Consequently the play degenerates into a quasi-trial in which
Menelaus presides as judge, Hecabe, ex-queen of Troy, represents
the prosecution, and Helen pleads her own cause. In the third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
place, when a court scene was out of the question a debate of
some kind was often dragged in. Of course “struggle” is of the
essence of drama and a formal “agon” was by derivation almost
indispensable in Old Comedy (see <a href="#Page_42">pp. 42-44</a>), but I am now referring
to something different. Perhaps the most glaring instance
is found in Euripides’ <i>Madness of Heracles</i> (vss. 158 ff.). Lycus
has resolved upon Amphitryon’s speedy death, yet they both
stop to argue whether it be better to fight with the spear or the
bow! Finally, since in the law courts the addresses of the
contending parties were equalized by means of the “water-clock”
(the <i>clepsydra</i>), it is not surprising that the speeches of
sharply contrasted characters in tragedy are occasionally made
of exactly the same length. The best example occurs in Euripides’
<i>Hecabe</i>, where Polymestor’s speech of fifty-one lines is
exactly balanced by that of the Trojan queen (cf. vss. 1132-82
and 1187-1237). In Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i> there are
seven pairs of contrasted speeches, two of which are exactly equal
(cf. vss. 422-36 = 437-51, and 568-96 = 597-625, and two others
are nearly so; cf. vss. 375-96 ≠ 397-416 and 631-52 ≠ 653-76).
If we had before us the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the tragic writers it is
likely that these and some other minor inequalities would be
resolved. Thus in Euripides’ <i>Medea</i>, Jason speaks fifty-four
lines in reply to the heroine’s fifty-five (cf. vss. 465-519 ≠ 522-75);
but there is some reason for believing that vs. 468 is interpolated.
Again, in Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i> the speeches of Creon and Haemon
would precisely correspond (cf. vss. 639-80 and 683-723), if we
suppose a verse to have dropped out after vs. 690. In conclusion
it ought to be stated that such balancing was quite congenial to
the fondness for symmetry which characterized the Greek genius
in every field of endeavor.</p>

<p>Perhaps the one idea which was most fixed in the popular
consciousness of ancient Greece was that of Nemesis, the goddess
who punished the overweening presumption arising from long-continued
prosperity and success. Herodotus’ history exemplifies
the notion both in its main theme, the crushing defeat
which brought Persia’s long series of victories to a close, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
numerous digressions, such as the story of Polycrates and his
ring. Accordingly, when Phrynichus in his <i>Phoenician Women</i>
and afterward Aeschylus in his <i>Persians</i> undertook to celebrate
the Persian rout they were careful to avoid a display of the pride
which had ruined the invading host, by laying the scene in the
Orient and exhibiting the mourning of Persia, not the triumph of
Greece (see <a href="#Page_124">p. 124</a>, above). Again, in the seven pairs of contrasted
speeches just mentioned as occurring in Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against
Thebes</i>, a messenger states in turn the name of the Argive champion
who is to assail each of the seven gates of Thebes, describing
his actions, words, the device upon his shield, etc., and the king
in a similar manner matches each enemy with a warrior of his
own. It is not without significance that to a Greek mind “the
boasts and blazons of the champions convict them of presumption,
and doom them beforehand to failure. The answers of
Eteocles are always right, take advantage of the enemy’s
insolence, and secure divine favour by studied moderation.”<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
Still again, in the same playwright’s <i>Agamemnon</i> appears an
incident which to the uninitiated modern reader seems forced
and unworthy of the prominence and space assigned to it.
Clytemnestra has been untrue to her lord during his long absence
at Troy and is now prepared by her paramour’s help to murder
him. Agamemnon himself, thanks to the recent smiles of
fortune, is in the sort of position which would easily expose him
to the vengeance of Nemesis. In the play (vss. 905-57) Clytemnestra
skilfully takes advantage of this situation in order to
array the powerful goddess upon her side. She urges Agamemnon
not to set his conquering foot upon the common earth but to
pass from his chariot into the palace over a purple tapestry. The
king shrinks from an act which would be more becoming to a god
than a mortal, but finally yields to his wife’s insistence. The
result is that to a Greek audience he would seem to invite and
almost to deserve the doom which his unfaithful spouse quickly
brings upon him. These instances from the many available
suffice to indicate Greek feeling on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>The poets of New Comedy leaned heavily upon the “long
arm of coincidence.” The young women who are the recipients
of the gilded youths’ favors are frequently found in the outcome
to be free-born, the children of respectable parents, and acceptable
wives. In several instances the victim of violence at some
nocturnal festival has unwittingly become the spouse of her
ravisher. The situation is aggravated by the unity of time.
Men who have been absent from their homes for months or years
must some day return to their households, pregnant women must
at last be delivered of their offspring, long-standing debts must
finally fall due, and the escapades of spoiled sons must at some
time be brought to light and receive the attention of “hard-hearted”
parents. Coming singly, such occurrences occasion
no surprise. But when several of that sort are crowded into a
period of twenty-four hours or less in play after play, to our
minds the coincidence becomes well-nigh intolerable. It seems
likely, however, that the ancients regarded such concatenations
of events with more kindly eyes, for the reason that Chance or
Fortune (Τύχη) was commonly accepted as exercising supreme
authority over the lives and fortunes of men. This conception
also helps to explain the curious immunity from punishment
which was usually enjoyed by the scheming slaves in comedy.
Of course to a race whose national characteristics were embodied
in the wily Odysseus, cleverness, however unscrupulous, always
seemed to elevate its practitioners above the rules of ordinary
morality. But more. Just as “in the days of the <i>Odyssey</i> a man
merely required to be skilful at deceiving his fellows to become
a favorite of Athena’s, so in the days of New Comedy this
quality gave him a claim to the favor of the queen of the world—omnipotent
Tyche.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>It is not always realized how almost oriental was the seclusion
in which respectable women were kept at Athens during the
period of its greatness in drama. Respectable women of good
family were not permitted to leave their homes except for special
reasons, nor to converse with men other than near relatives or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
slaves. When it is remembered that the physical arrangements
of the Greek theaters did not readily admit of interior scenes
(see <a href="#Page_237">pp. 237 ff.</a>, above) it will be understood how difficult it was
for an ancient playwright to bring women of the better class
upon his stage. This applies particularly to comedy as being a
more accurate mirror of contemporaneous manners; in tragedy,
as will presently appear, it was counteracted by another factor.
At weddings, funerals, and religious festivals women, especially
married women, were allowed greater liberty than at other times.
Thus, in Aristophanes’ <i>Women at the Thesmophoria</i> the coming
of the <i>festa</i> affords them an opportunity of carrying on the business
of the play. In the same writer’s <i>Women in Council</i> they
act in secret and disguised as men until their coup d’état has
succeeded and the government has been voted into their hands.
The situation in Aristophanes’ <i>Lysistrata</i> is quite as abnormal,
being nothing more or less than a “sex strike!” In more conventional
plays the speaking characters, apart from divinities,
are practically restricted to women of the demimonde, foreign
residents (<i>metics</i>), female slaves, those other virtuous but vulgar
creatures whom poverty has compelled to seek a livelihood in
various business pursuits of the humbler sort, and finally women
advanced in years, shrewish in disposition, and unattractive in
person. The first and last types are especially common in New
Comedy, while Plautus’ <i>Persian</i> is said to be unique in its
presentation of a chaste and free-born maiden in an active rôle.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
Even the girl who has excited the young man’s affections and
whose counterpart in modern drama would be a conspicuous
figure is seldom seen and is not always heard. The most that
she seems normally capable of doing is to ejaculate a cry of agony
from behind the scenes at the moment of childbirth. This is
the more surprising since the fact of her Attic citizenship is
rarely established and sometimes is not even suspected until the
very close of the play. The poet’s consciousness of what he
intends to make of her—a free-born citizen and a legal wife—apparently
constrains him to protect her from an unconventionality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
of conduct which, though suitable to her present condition,
would afterward be looked back upon with regret by herself,
her husband and newly recovered relatives, and even by the
spectators themselves. Truth to tell the girls from whom an
Athenian was required to take his bride were scarcely fitted to
be his intellectual companions or to grace a dialogue in drama,
while the best of the courtesans could qualify in either capacity.
According to American notions the marriage of convenience
arranged by the parents is hardly warranted to produce domestic
felicity. But the hero of Greek comedy often selected a mistress
for graces of mind and person and afterward, when her legitimate
birth was discovered, gladly made her his wife. At least such
matches ought to have resulted happily. Yet surprisingly little
is ever said of married bliss and affection arising from any sort
of union. While this social situation prevented the ancient
dramatist from introducing certain scenes which are the stock
in trade of the modern playwright, in one respect it was of service
to him. Since practically no attention was paid to the girl’s
wishes in such matters and almost none to the youth’s, the speed
with which engagements could be made and unmade or consummated
in wedlock aided materially in observing the unity
of time. The plots and concentrated action of many plays in
the New Comedy (cf. for example Terence’s <i>Andrian Girl</i>)
would be quite impossible if women in such a case were not
passive and helpless instruments in the hands of others. Professor
Lounsbury (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 120 ff.) has convincingly shown
what a stumbling-block the unity of time proved to the classical
dramatists of Western Europe who tried to conform to the
unities but lived in a society to which such rapidity in courtship
was repugnant.</p>

<p>In Greek tragedy the representation of women is strikingly
different from that in comedy. Whereas in this respect the
latter reacted to the usage of contemporaneous society, tragedy
reverted to the practice of Homer. In the <i>Iliad</i> women like
Helen and Andromache, suitably attended, not only traverse the
Trojan streets but appear on the walls and among the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
without losing caste or being regarded as immodest; and though
Helen’s elopement with his brother was the source of all Troy’s
present woes, Hector addresses her with far more consideration
than he shows the wayward Paris. In the fourth book of the
<i>Odyssey</i> she assists Menelaus at their Spartan home in entertaining
the strangers from Ithaca and Pylus, and freely participates
in the conversation without embarrassment and as an equal.
How faithful a picture these poems present of the social situation
in Homer’s own day is largely beside the question, since it is
evident that they portray the events of a bygone age, viz., the
close of that “Aegean” or “Minoan” civilization which has been
unearthed by Schliemann on the Greek mainland and more recently
by Evans and others in Crete.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is certain that women must have lived on a footing of greater
equality with the men than in any other ancient civilization, and we see in
the frescoes of Knossos conclusive indications of an open and easy association
of men and women, corresponding to our idea of “Society,” at the
Minoan Court unparalleled till our own day.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The extant remains clearly demonstrate that Homer’s delineation
was at the least derived from a genuine tradition. In view
of the fact that with three or four exceptions (see <a href="#Page_123">pp. 123 f.</a>, above)
the themes of tragedy were always selected from Homeric or
other mythological sources, it was natural that the Greek tragedians
should take over from him a social system which so
conveniently liberated them from the restrictions of contemporaneous
customs. It is unnecessary to cite passages to prove that
they actually did this; the women of almost every tragedy move
about with a freedom and conduct themselves with an independence
such as no respectable woman among the playwright’s contemporaries
could have asserted.</p>

<p>Nor is it peculiar that so artificial a pose is not consistently
maintained. Occasionally, an unconscious sense of outraged
propriety causes the dramatist to put words into a woman’s
mouth which stand in glaring contrast with the rest of the scene.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
In Euripides’ <i>Andromache</i>, Hermione’s confidential slave brings
their dialogue to a close by saying to her mistress:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, pass within; make not thyself a show</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before this house, lest thou shouldst get thee shame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before this palace seen of men, my child.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Vss. 877 ff.; Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In real life these words would furnish an excellent motive for
withdrawing; how artificial they are in tragedy appears from the
fact that, though a strange-looking man is now seen approaching,
Hermione remains upon the scene! In the same author’s
<i>Electra</i> (vss. 341 ff.) that heroine’s peasant-husband finds her
conversing with her brother and Pylades (though she recognizes
neither) and exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How now? What strangers these about my doors?</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">... Beseemeth not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That with young men a wife should stand in talk.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The man’s lowly birth and usually deferential attitude toward
his wife make these words seem especially incongruous, and
Electra promptly apologizes for them. Sometimes these
anachronisms are intentional and fulfill a deliberate purpose.
In Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i> (vss. 88 ff.), Antigone and a servant
are about to appear on the flat roof of the palace in order to
catch a glimpse of the invading army; but for technical reasons
(see <a href="#Page_171">pp. 171 f.</a>, above) it is necessary that Antigone’s entrance
be slightly delayed. Accordingly, the slave comes into view
first and is made to afford an excuse for her tardy appearance
which would have been legitimate for a fifth-century princess but
which to a Homeric woman or one at the period of the dramatic
time of the play would have seemed to spring from false modesty.</p>

<p>As intimated at the beginning it would be possible to extend
this chapter indefinitely. One more point must suffice. The
belief was widespread among the Greeks that if a man’s body
failed of burial his shade was forced to wander for a season on
this side of the river Styx and was thus cut off from association
with the great majority of departed spirits; the obligation of
attending to the funeral rites rested upon the nearest kin of the
deceased. It was inevitable that a doctrine so intimately
connected with the life of the people should frequently appear in
their literature. Thus the <i>Iliad</i> does not close with the deaths
of Patroclus and Hector, but two whole books are devoted to
an account of their funerals. Likewise in the <i>Odyssey</i>, however
unsympathetic has been his delineation of the suitors’ conduct,
nevertheless Homer does not pass by the final disposition of their
bodies in silence (cf. xxiv. 417). In tragedy, which often involves
the death of the hero, naturally this matter is frequently mentioned.
In Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i> it provides the mainspring of
the action. Because Polynices fell in arms against his native
country, Creon forbade his burial, but before the call of a duty
so sacred Antigone deemed not her life precious and performed
the formal rites for her brother’s body in defiance of the king’s
command. According to modern feeling, when the hero falls
upon his sword at vs. 865 of Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i>, the dénouement
must have arrived and the ending be close at hand; as a matter
of fact, the play continues for over five hundred verses. To the
Greeks no less important than the fact of his death was the
treatment which was to be accorded his corpse, and the honors
which Ajax received in Attica as a “hero” in the technical,
religious sense of that term made this a matter of far more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
moment than would have been true even in the case of an ordinary
man. Aeschylus’ <i>Seven against Thebes</i> concludes with a
dirge between Antigone and Ismene over the bodies of their two
brothers, and an altercation between a public herald and
Antigone in which she declares her intention of defying the
state edict by burying Polynices. The genuineness of these
scenes has been assailed on technical grounds but in my opinion
unwarrantably (see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>, above). They have been charged
also with carrying the play (and the trilogy) past the natural
stopping-point and to an inconclusive close. But despite any
considerations which can be urged in its support, this objection
ignores the Greek feeling concerning the paramount importance of
interment and cannot be allowed. Even modern audiences
have sometimes felt a certain sympathy with this point of view.
“The typical Elizabethan tragedy does not deal with the mistakes
of a night, but with the long—often life-long—struggles
of its hero. Such a play must have an appropriate ending.
After the audience has sympathized with a Hamlet or a Brutus
through many a scene, it is not satisfied with a sudden death
and a drop of a curtain with a thud. It asks to see the body
solemnly and reverently borne off the stage as if to its last
resting place. And this was the respect which the honored dead
received on the Elizabethan stage.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">THE INFLUENCE OF THEATRICAL MACHINERY AND DRAMATIC CONVENTIONS<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></span></h2>

</div>

<p>We have already noted that the Greek theater had no facilities
for the direct representation of interior scenes (see <a href="#Page_237">pp. 237-42</a>,
above). Of the many subterfuges there mentioned as available
for or utilized by the ancient playwrights it is now in place to
elaborate upon one. I refer to the <i>eccyclema</i>, one of the strangest
and most conventional pieces of machinery that any theater
has ever seen.</p>

<p>If it were desired to disclose to the audience the corpse of
someone who has just been done to death behind the scenes,
perhaps with the murderers still gloating over their crime, or to
set any similar interior view before the faithful eyes of the spectators,
the simplest device was to fling open the appropriate door
of the scene-building and thus to display the desired objects or
persons close behind the opening. Whatever may be said for
such a method under other conditions, in the Greek theater it
ran afoul of certain practical considerations. For example, the
wings of the auditorium extended around so far (<a href="#figure22">Fig. 22</a>) that
spectators seated there could have obtained no satisfactory view
through the opened doors of the scene-building. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
during the last quarter-century not a few scholars have maintained
that this was the sole means which the Greek playwrights
employed for such a purpose. But the ancient commentators
often speak of a contrivance which was used to bring a supposedly
interior scene out of the opened doors and more fully into the
view of the audience. This device is sometimes described as
“turning” or “revolving” (στρέφειν)<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> and sometimes as being
“rolled out” (ἐκ, “out” + κυκλεῖν, to “wheel”). And though
eccyclema (ἐκκύκλημα) was used as the generic term I am persuaded
that there were in fact two types of machine corresponding
to different conditions in the Athenian theater.</p>

<p>When the first scene-building was erected, about 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, it
must have been simple and unpretentious, having neither parascenia
nor proscenium. Probably it consisted also of but a
single story, though in <a href="#figure74">Fig. 74</a><a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> I have given it a low clerestory
with small windows for the admission of light into the scene-building.
The roof would thus have been better suited for the
occasional appearance of actors upon the housetop, as in Aeschylus’
<i>Agamemnon</i> (458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). In addition to the usual doors in
the front of the scene-building (<i>A</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>E</i> in <a href="#figure74">Fig. 74</a>), I believe
that a butterfly valve, to the base of which a semicircular platform
was attached, was used to close one or more other openings.
In <a href="#figure74">Fig. 74</a> one of these is shown closed and not in use at <i>B</i> and
another open and in action at <i>D</i>. The size of the semicircular
platform would be limited only by the depth of the scene-building
and the space between the front doors, and there would
be ample room for several persons upon the eccyclema at a time.
Therefore when a deed of violence had been committed indoors
it was possible, by revolving one of the valves after a tableau
had been posed upon its platform, to place a quasi-interior scene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
before the spectators. This is Mr. Exon’s theory of the eccyclema,
and it admirably fits the conditions in the Athenian
theater at an early date.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure74" style="max-width: 37.5em;">

  <p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>—The Athenian
  Theater of About 460 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Showing the
  Earlier Type of Eccyclema.</p>
  <p class="captionref"><a href="#Footnote_356">See p. 285, n. 2</a></p>
</div>

<p>Thus, Aeschylus’ <i>Eumenides</i>, which belongs to this period
(458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), opens with a monologue of the Pythian priestess
(see <a href="#Page_305">p. 305</a>, below). At vs. 33 she enters the temple, but immediately
returns, so shaken by the sight within that she cannot
walk, but crawls. She has seen a blood-stained man (Orestes)
at the omphalus and before him a sleeping band of hideous Furies
(vss. 34-63). At vs. 64 we must suppose that the eccyclema
revolves with Apollo, Hermes, and Orestes mounted upon it.
The first named bids the matricide to leave Delphi and speed to
Athens and Hermes to guard him on his journey. Whereupon
the two step from the platform and flee through one of the parodi,
and the eccyclema, with Apollo still upon it, is revolved back
into its original position (vs. 93). Here we may note a curious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
incongruity; the platform of the eccyclema is actually out of
doors; nominally it is indoors. If the latter fact were kept
steadfastly in mind, a character could not step directly from the
eccyclema into the orchestra (as Orestes does here) but could
only pass out through one of the doors after the eccyclema had
been closed again. It is of a piece with this that the characters
are not only spoken of as being indoors but sometimes as being
out of doors. At vs. 94 the ghost of Clytemnestra appears in
the orchestra (or perhaps is merely heard from within the scene-building)
calling upon the Furies to waken and pursue their
escaping prey. Beginning at vs. 117 their cries and ejaculations
are heard at intervals, and at vs. 143 they burst into the orchestra
for their entrance song (the parodus). At its conclusion (vs. 178)
Apollo comes out and drives them from his precinct.</p>

<p>Sometimes the opening and shutting of the back scene is
distinctly referred to. Thus in Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i>,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> vs. 344, the
coryphaeus cries to the attendants: “Open there; perhaps even
by looking upon me he may acquire a more sober mood”; and
as Tecmessa replies “Lo! I open,” the door of the hero’s tent
is opened and Ajax is seen amid the slaughtered cattle, the
victims of his misdirected vengeance. After playing a prominent
lyrical and speaking part in the scene which follows, Ajax
orders the door to be closed with all speed and disappears from
view (vs. 593).</p>

<p>But the eccyclema was also described as a low, trundle platform,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
large enough to accommodate several persons and narrow
enough to be pushed through the doors of the scene-building, and
this type would be more suitable for the conditions which obtained
in the Athenian theater from about 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (see <a href="#Page_235">pp. 235</a>
and <a href="#Page_292">292</a>). At this period the scene-building was raised to a
second story and embellished with wooden proscenium and
parascenia, a crane came into use, etc. Under these conditions
the earlier type of eccyclema could no longer be so large nor so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
easily seen, being hampered in both particulars by the proscenium.
On the other hand the new type could be made as
long as the scene-building was deep and could be pushed forward
as far as might be necessary.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Thus in Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i>
(425 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), Dicaeopolis appears before the house of Euripides,
who is lounging within doors. In response to the former’s
knock and summons “to be wheeled out” Euripides says “I will
be wheeled out,” and is pushed upon the stage (ἐκκυκλήθητι
... ἐκκυκλήσομαι, vs. 408). The conversation which ensues
between Dicaeopolis outdoors and Euripides supposedly indoors
does not conclude until vs. 479, when the latter exclaims: “The
fellow is insolent; shut the doors.” Perhaps in this instance,
for parodic effect, a trundle couch itself is shoved through the
door instead of a stationary couch upon a trundle platform.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
Very similar is the scene in Aristophanes’ <i>Women at the Thesmophoria</i>
(about 411 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), where Agathon is wheeled out before
Euripides and Mnesilochus. Here again the verbs ἐκκυκλούμενος
in vs. 96 and εἰσκυκλησάτω at the conclusion of the scene in
vs. 265 do not permit me to doubt that the eccyclema, or a comic
substitute, was employed. It is probably no accident that
Euripides figures in both of these scenes. He is “hoist with his
own petar” as having invented, or been a frequent user of, this
mechanism.</p>

<p>The passage of tragedy in which most authorities concede
the employment of the eccyclema is Euripides’ <i>The Madness
of Heracles</i> (vss. 1029-1402). Chronologically this play falls
somewhere between the <i>Acharnians</i> and the <i>Women at the
Thesmophoria</i>. In his madness Heracles has slain his wife and
three children within the palace and at last has fallen into a dazed
torpor; whereupon his friends have bound him to a broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
column. As the chorus chant “Alas! Behold the doors of the
stately palace fall asunder” (vss. 1029 f.), the hero bound to
a pillar amid the slain is pushed forward on the eccyclema.
At vs. 1089 he recovers consciousness and begins to speak; at
vs. 1123 Amphitryon loosens him; and at vs. 1163 Theseus
enters and finally (vs. 1402) persuades him to descend into the
orchestra.</p>

<p>Still another theatrical contrivance was called the μηχανή
(“machine”), which about 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> came to be used to bring
divinities before the ancient audiences. This was a crane and
pulley arrangement, mounted in one of the side wings (parascenia),
whereby persons or objects could be brought from
behind the second story (the episcenium) and held suspended
in the air or let down upon the roof of the scene-building or into
the orchestra, or could be lifted in an opposite direction. This
development is of interest also from the structural standpoint as
indicating that whatever the situation may have been earlier,
at least from this time on the scene-building was provided with
an episcenium (see <a href="#Page_67">pp. 67 f.</a>, above).</p>

<p>Before considering the use of the <i>machina</i> further, it will be
worth while to trace briefly how gods played their parts in the
Greek theater. Prior to the erection of a scene-building, about
465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the scene was perforce laid in the open countryside (see
<a href="#Page_226">p. 226</a>, above) and the playwrights had no option but to place
divinities and mortals in immediate juxtaposition, after the
Homeric fashion, in the orchestra. For the same reason, however
these characters might be thought of as traveling before they
entered the theater, they rested under the prosaic necessity, as
soon as they were seen by the spectators, of moving upon the
solid earth. Thus in Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, Oceanus
enters at vs. 284 with the words:</p>

<p class="noindent">It will be noted that there is nothing here which requires or
implies flight through the air within sight of the audience.
Evidently Oceanus rides upon a fantastic creature which is rolled
along by hidden power or which walks on disguised human legs.
A similar interpretation must be set upon the lines which refer
to the chorus’ mode of entrance in the same play. At vs. 124
Prometheus cries out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hark again! I hear the whirring</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Here again there is no need of supposing that the choral car does
not rest solidly upon the ground. Its aërial motion is entirely off-scene.</p>

<p>Even at a later period, when more sophisticated devices were
available, the gods still continued on occasion to use strictly
terrestrial means of locomotion and to stand in the orchestra
on a level with purely human characters. For example, in
Sophocles’ <i>Ajax</i>, Athena appears before the tent of that hero and
converses first with Odysseus and then with Ajax. In Euripides’
posthumous <i>Bacchanals</i>, Dionysus is seen <i>in propria persona</i>
before the house of Pentheus and afterward (in disguise) enters
and departs from its portals. Still again, in the pseudo-Euripidean
<i>Rhesus</i>, which is usually regarded as a fourth-century
production, Athena comes before Hector’s tent to advise and
encourage Odysseus and then to deceive Paris (cf. especially
vss. 627 f.). On the contrary, the words of the chorus in vss.
885 f. of this play show that the Muse appears above their heads.
Thus it is an error to think that the more primitive methods
of presenting divinities were entirely superseded by later ones;
the different methods existed side by side and might even be used
in the same play.</p>

<p>After the erection of a scene-building, about 465 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, it became
possible to employ the roof as a higher stage for certain scenes.
At the beginning of Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i> the guard is found
posted upon the palace roof, on watch for the last in the series
of beacon lights from Troy. In Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Maids</i>,
Antigone and an old servant appear on top of the royal palace
in order to view the hostile army (cf. vss. 88 ff.). In these and
other instances the roof of the scene-building (or at a later
period the top of the proscenium) was pressed into service.
Moreover, although this spot was of course not the exclusive
place of speaking, yet, since it was never used for dancing but
only for speaking, it came to be called the logium (λογεῖον) or
“speaking-place” <i>par excellence</i> (see <a href="#Page_59">p. 59</a>, above). This arrangement
was especially useful when a scene was to be thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
of as taking place in heaven. So in Aeschylus’ lost play entitled
<i>The Weighing of Souls</i>, Zeus was represented as placing the fates
of Achilles and Memnon into the scales, while Thetis and Eos
prayed for their sons. The same meaning is assigned the logium
also in Aristophanes’ <i>Peace</i>, in which Trygaeus on the back of
his beetle mounts from earth to heaven, i.e., from the orchestra
to the top of the proscenium. The dramatists were not slow
to perceive that no other part of the theater was so well adapted
for the awe-compelling theophanies with which the Greeks were
so fond of terminating their tragedies. There is no doubt that
this method of introducing divinities was employed in several
of our extant plays, but the absence of stage directions makes it
difficult to differentiate the instances sharply.</p>

<p>Finally about 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the machine (μηχανή) came into use.
Possibly this is employed in Euripides’ <i>Medea</i> (431 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) in order
to carry away that heroine and the bodies of her children in the
chariot of the sun-god, but the situation is doubtful. It is almost
certainly a mistake, however, to attribute the machine, as some
do, to the time of Aeschylus. Whether Euripides was its
inventor or not, he was extraordinarily fond of using it. Indeed
it has been remarked that “in almost every play of Euripides
something flies through the air.” At any rate the earliest sure
instance of the machine occurs in Euripides’ lost <i>Bellerophon</i>,
which was brought out some time before 425 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> By its means the
hero in this play was enabled to mount from earth to heaven, i.e.,
from the orchestra to the top of the proscenium, upon the winged
steed, Pegasus. This scene is parodied in Aristophanes’ <i>Peace</i>
(421 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), in which Trygaeus makes a similar flight on the back
of a beetle. Somewhat later the same device enabled Perseus
in Euripides’ lost <i>Andromeda</i> to fly to the rocks upon which that
heroine had been bound. In Aristophanes’ <i>Clouds</i> (423 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
it was employed to suspend Socrates in a basket, whence he could
look down upon the troubles of mortals and survey the heavenly
bodies. Especially important is the situation in Euripides’
<i>Orestes</i> (408 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Orestes and Pylades have fled to the palace
roof, dragging Hermione with them. Menelaus is outside the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
bolted door below. Suddenly Apollo appears (vs. 1625) with
Helen at his side. The divinity begins to speak as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Menelaus, peace to thine infuriate mood:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I, Phoebus, Leto’s son, here call on thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peace thou, Orestes, too, whose sword doth guard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yon maid, that thou mayst hear the words I bear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Helen, whose death thou hast essayed, to sting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart of Menelaus, yet hast missed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is here,—whom <i>wrapped in folds of air ye see</i> (ἐv αἰθέρος πτυχαῖς),—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From death delivered, and not slain of thee, etc.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The italicized words show that Apollo and Helen stand above
all the other actors in the drama, who are themselves standing
on two different levels; and it is evident that the machine was
utilized for this purpose.</p>

<p>The last example is typical of a large class of instances in
which a divinity appears as a splendid climax to the events of
the play. It is plain that in all or practically all of these the god
is raised above the other performers, as would be only appropriate
for an effective close; but whether the deity merely came
forward upon the logium or was brought into view by means of a
machine is not always an easy matter to determine. By a
natural extension of meaning, however, such an apparition at
the close of a play came to be called a “god from the machine”
(θεὸς ἀπὸ μηχανῆς; <i>deus ex machina</i>) regardless of the method used
for his appearance. By a further extension of meaning μηχανή
was used to designate any mechanical artifice, such as the “long
arm of coincidence,” for example. Thus Aristotle criticized the
μηχανή in Euripides’ <i>Medea</i>, but from another passage it becomes
clear that he was referring, not to the use of an actual machine
at the dénouement, but only to the improbability involved in the
appearance of King Aegeus in the course of the play.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>There are several ancient notices which refer to the use that
inexpert playwrights made of the deus ex machina in order to
extricate their characters when the plot had become complicated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
beyond the possibility of disentanglement by purely natural
means. It would seem that in the hands of second-rate poets
the deus was frequently so employed. In particular it has often
been charged that Euripides was guilty of this practice, but in my
opinion without due warrant. It is true that he concluded fully
half of his eighteen extant plays in this manner, besides several
other instances in the plays now lost; but with only one exception
his principal motive was never to relieve himself of the embarrassment
into which the confusion of his plot had involved him.
The truth of this statement appears most clearly in the <i>Iphigenia
among the Taurians</i> (see <a href="#Page_201">pp. 201 f.</a>, above). At vs. 1392 all the
immediate requirements of the drama have been met: Orestes,
Iphigenia, and Pylades have made good their escape, bearing
the image of Artemis. The poet could have stopped here without
requiring the aid of a divinity. Instead he preferred to plunge
himself into such a plight as only a deity could rescue him from,
for in the succeeding verses a messenger reports that contrary
wind and wave are driving the refugees back to land. King
Thoas just has time to issue quick commands when Athena
appears (vs. 1435) and bids him cease his efforts. Surely the
playwright’s difficulties here are self-imposed and must be
regarded as having furnished the excuse rather than the reason
for the use of the deus ex machina. What other objects might
he have had in mind? It has already been suggested (<a href="#Page_202">p. 202</a>,
above) that this device enabled him to bring the melodramatic
course of the action to a more dignified and truly tragic close.
Also he thus found it possible to rescue the chorus, who had been
promised a safe return to Greece but had been left behind. But
the fact that the chorus in the same poet’s <i>Helen</i> is irremediably
left in the lurch after the same fashion (see <a href="#Page_160">pp. 160 f.</a>, above) implies
that this was a lesser consideration. Again, toward the close
of Euripides’ <i>Suppliants</i>, Adrastus has vowed the eternal gratitude
of Argos to Athens for having secured the return of her slain.
But the appearance of Athena at vs. 1183 makes her a witness
to this, and her demand that Adrastus’ promise be ratified by
an oath converts it into a sacred obligation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>But after all these are only occasional motives, while a more
important result is obtained again and again. In the <i>Iphigenia</i>,
Euripides took advantage of Athena’s presence to have her
foretell the heroine’s later career and final decease in Attica. It
is unnecessary to point out that the presence of a divinity was
highly serviceable and appropriate for such a purpose. We have
already seen (<a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>, above) that exactly the same situation
obtains in the <i>Andromache</i>. In this way the poet was enabled to
burst through the restricting influences which caused the normal
observance of the unities of time and place and to include other
days and other places within the purview of his play. Frequently
there is included in this an aetiological explanation of
rites which were observed in the dramatist’s own day. Thus in
Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i> (vss. 1423 ff.), Artemis promises that the
maidens of Troezen will perform certain ceremonies in honor
of the hero’s sufferings, and in the <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i>
(vss. 1446 ff.), Athena enjoins upon Orestes to establish the
temple and worship of Artemis Tauropolos at Brauron in Attica.</p>

<p>It would take too long to examine here every instance of the
deus ex machina in Euripides. For that I must refer the reader
to Professor Decharme’s interesting discussion.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Suffice it to
state that in every case the element of prediction is brought into
play. This appears even in the <i>Orestes</i>, the only piece in which
the theophany is frankly and undisguisedly employed to provide
Euripides with a dénouement. Orestes and Electra stand
condemned to death for having murdered their mother. Being
disappointed in the hope of receiving succor from their uncle,
Menelaus, they determine to punish him for his recreancy by
slaying Helen and to hold his daughter Hermione as a hostage in
order to force him to secure the recall of the decree against them.
Helen has now supposedly been slain, Menelaus stands angry and
baffled before the bolted doors, Orestes with his sword at
Hermione’s throat taunts him from the palace roof. If any
regard is to be paid to verisimilitude or human psychology, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
reconciliation between these conflicting elements is possible;
but at this moment Apollo appears, and his fiat (see <a href="#Page_293">p. 293</a>)
resolves every feud. The god goes beyond this, however, and in
typical fashion predicts (or ordains) the later career of each
character.</p>

<p>It is but fair to Euripides to state that even Sophocles, that
master of dramatic writing, found the deus ex machina as
indispensable in his <i>Philoctetes</i> as did the former in his <i>Orestes</i>.
Philoctetes had come into possession of the bow of Heracles, and
having been abandoned on the island of Lemnos by the leaders
of the Greek expedition against Troy he cherished an implacable
hatred against his former associates. But now the Greeks have
received an oracle to the effect that the person and weapons of
Philoctetes are necessary for the capture of Ilium. In Sophocles’
play the task of meeting these conditions has been laid upon the
wily Odysseus and the noble Neoptolemus. By a trick they
succeed in gaining possession of the bow and by another trick
are in a fair way of enticing the inexorable hero on board a ship
bound for Troy, when the generous son of Achilles refuses to
proceed further with so infamous a scheme and finally returns
his weapons to Philoctetes. This development was inevitable if
the character of Neoptolemus is to be maintained consistently;
but it leaves the characters in a hopeless deadlock. At this
juncture (vs. 1408) the deified Heracles appears to reveal the
purposes of Zeus, and Philoctetes abandons his resentment.
Here again the element of prophecy is associated with the deus
ex machina, Heracles foretelling the healing of Philoctetes’
wound and his future career of glory at Troy and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Much nonsense has been indulged in by modern authorities
in ridiculing this contrivance of the Greek theater. This has
sprung partly from a misapprehension of the real situation and
partly from a failure to realize that devices fully as forced and
artificial have been employed by the supreme masters of dramatic
art in modern times. Of course I do not mean that an actual
μηχανή has often been brought to view in modern theaters or that
divinities have frequently trod the stage. Nevertheless a close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
equivalent of the deus ex machina, in the broader sense, has not
rarely been resorted to. For example, at the close of Shakespeare’s
<i>Cymbeline</i> the king declares, <i>as the result of an oracle</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Although the victor</i>, we submit to Caesar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the Roman empire, promising</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To pay our wonted tribute.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, in <i>As You Like It</i> everything has been satisfactorily
settled except one point: the spectators would hardly rest
content to think of the characters as spending the remainder of
their lives in the Forest of Arden. This detail is adjusted by
means of a messenger, who reports that the usurping duke had
addressed a mighty power with which to capture his brother
and put him to the sword:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where <i>meeting with an old religious man</i>,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And all their lands restored to them again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That were with him exiled.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Finally, not to extend this list unduly, in Molière’s <i>Tartuffe</i> by
the time that Orgon has at length unmasked the hypocrite he
had played into his hand to such an extent, by deeding him his
property and by intrusting him with incriminating papers, that
it is impossible to conceive how he can be extricated. But at
this crisis an officer of police in the name of the French king
(almost a divine figure in those days) rescues him from his
troubles:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Monsieur, dismiss all anxious fears. We live beneath a prince the foe
of fraud,—a prince whose eyes can penetrate all hearts; whose mind the art
of no impostor can deceive.... This one was powerless to mislead him;
those wily schemes he instantly detected, discerning with his keen sagacity
the inmost folds of that most treacherous heart. Coming to denounce you,
the wretch betrayed himself; and by the stroke of some high justice the
prince discovered him, by his own words, to be a great impostor, ...
In a word, the monarch ... ordered me to follow him here and see to
what lengths his impudence would go, and then to do justice on him for your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
sake. Yes, I am ordered to take from his person the papers which he boasts
of holding, and place them in your hands. The king, of his sovereign power,
annuls the deed you made him of your property; and he forgives you for
the secret to which your friendship for an exile led you. [Wormeley’s
translation.]</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Who, with such examples of artificial and mechanical dénouements
before him, will cast the first stone at the deus ex machina
of the Greeks?<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>In a technical sense “prologue” came to denote the histrionic
passage before the entrance song of the chorus (the parodus)
(see <a href="#Page_192">p. 192</a>, above). Such prologues are not found in Aeschylus’
<i>Suppliants</i> and <i>Persians</i>, which begin with the choral parodus.
The earliest prologue of which we have knowledge occurred in
Phrynichus’ lost play, the <i>Phoenician Women</i> (476 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), in which
a eunuch opens the action by spreading places in the orchestra
for the counselors of the Persian empire and at the same time
announcing the defeat of Xerxes in Greece. On the other hand,
according to a late authority, prologues were the invention of
Thespis.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> In my opinion this contradiction is to be explained
as a confusion between the technical and non-technical uses of
the term. There is every reason for believing that prologues in
the technical sense just mentioned did not go back to the time
of Thespis. But the fully developed prologue was naturally
employed as a vehicle for the exposition, and the task of acquainting
his audience with data preliminary to the action and necessary
for comprehending the plot of course confronted Thespis no less
than later playwrights. Now it is evident that he could accomplish
this in any one of three ways: (1) He could utilize the choral
parodus for this purpose, as Aeschylus partially did in his
<i>Agamemnon</i>. Though this play has a prologue, the parodus is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
employed to rehearse the story of Iphigenia’s sacrifice and other
pertinent events. Somewhat similar is the parodus of Aeschylus’
<i>Persians</i>, which in the absence of a regular prologue opens the
play. Accordingly, the ancient argument to this play remarks:
“A chorus of elders ‘speaks the prologue’” (προλογίζει), using
the word in a popular sense. (2) The drama might begin with
a dialogue or duet between the chorus and an actor, somewhat
in the manner of the pseudo-Euripidean <i>Rhesus</i>. It is perhaps
unlikely that this technique was employed as early as Thespis.
(3) The exposition might be intrusted to the character who
speaks first after the choral parodus. Since the drama was then
in the one-actor stage, such a “prologue” would necessarily be
monologic. Some justification for this nomenclature may be
found in the ancient argument to Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>,
where it is stated that Oedipus προλογίζει. Since Antigone and
a stranger take part in this prologue as well as Oedipus, the verb
must here mean that Oedipus “makes the first speech.” Now
whatever may be true about Thespis having employed (1) or (2),
he certainly must have employed the third type of exposition,
and a “prologue” of this non-technical sort he can truthfully
be said to have invented.</p>

<p>It is a peculiarity of Euripides that he oftentimes combined
startling innovations with a reversion to archaic, or at least much
earlier, technique. Therefore, it is not surprising that he
preferred prologues which smack somewhat of this primitive
type. Of course this statement is not to be taken so literally
as to imply that he placed his prologues after the parodus. It
means that instead of retailing the essential antecedents of the
action piecemeal in the manner of Sophocles and Ibsen, he regularly
set the whole body of data before the spectators at once in
an opening soliloquy. This is normally succeeded by a dialogue
with which the dramatic action really begins. In other words
there is a prologue within a prologue: the histrionic passage
before the choral parodus (the prologue in the technical sense)
opens with a sharply differentiated monologue (a prologue in
the old, nontechnical sense). In my opinion the latter must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
regarded as consciously harking back to Thespian practice. An
excellent example of this technique is afforded by the <i>Alcestis</i>.
Here Apollo apostrophizes the palace of Admetus, thus revealing
the location of the scene (see <a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>). He then proceeds to
relate in detail how he had been forced to serve in the house of a
mortal, how considerately Admetus had treated him, how in
gratitude he had tricked the Fates into permitting Admetus to
present a voluntary substitute when premature death threatened
him, how Queen Alcestis is the only one found willing to die for
the king, that this is the day appointed for her vicarious act, etc.
It is noticeable that scant regard is here paid to dramatic illusion:
Apollo tells what the spectators need to know and because they
need to know it. He explains his leaving the palace on the
ground of the pollution which the death of Alcestis would bring
upon all indoors at the time (vs. 22). But no excuse is provided
for his long soliloquy. We have seen that the apostrophe to the
palace served another purpose; and in any case, since (unlike
the elements) houses were never regarded by the Greeks as either
divine or even animate, it would be no adequate motivation for
the monologue. The prologue concludes and the action proper
is set in motion by a quarrel between Apollo and Death, who is
now seen approaching.</p>

<p>This prologue is one of Euripides’ best. They are often
interminable and marred by long genealogies and other jejune
matter. Some of them are not undeserving of the strictures
which critics, both ancient and modern, have heaped upon them.
Yet they served many useful purposes, too, and there is no warrant
for utterly condemning the type as a whole. We have
already seen (<a href="#Page_258">p. 258</a>, above) that such a device enabled a dramatist
to circumvent the conditions which caused the conventional
observance of the unities of time and place and to bring earlier
events more explicitly within the scope of his play. The fact
that Euripides more often chose different themes for the plays
in each group instead of writing trilogies or tetralogies made
brevity of exposition a desideratum. Again, a desire for novelty
and the fact that Aeschylus and Sophocles had anticipated him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
in so many of his subjects caused him to depart widely from the
traditional accounts. Unless some warning of this were given,
it would sometimes be almost impossible for the ordinary spectator
to comprehend the action, and no other place was so
appropriate for such an explanation as the prologue. For
example, in the <i>Helen</i>, Euripides abandoned the account given
by Homer and most others in favor of the version invented by
Stesichorus. The audience had to comprehend not only that
Helen had been the chaste and loyal wife of Menelaus throughout
but also that there were two Helens—one the true Helen who
spent the years of the Trojan War in Egypt, and the other a
cloud-image Helen who eloped with Paris and was recovered by
Menelaus at the capture of the city. Surely a very clear statement
was required to render such a revamping of the legend clear
to everyone. Even the genealogical table was not without its
utility in this prologue, for the Egyptian king Theoclymenus
and his sister would mean nothing to most spectators until their
lineage was traced to the familiar names of Proteus and Nereus.</p>

<p>Quite apart from these considerations, however, there is still
something to be said for the Euripidean type of prologue.
Knowing that the spectators had no playbill, whatever the
dramatist wished to tell them concerning the antecedents of the
dramatic action he had to tell them in the play itself. And
though the plots of most tragedies were based upon oft-told
myths, yet we have the authority of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> for the statement
that even the best-known tales were known to but a few.
Furthermore, the Greek practice of attacking the series of
dramatic incidents, not at the beginning or in the middle, but
only at the end, of excluding everything but the culmination or
fifth act (see <a href="#Page_266">pp. 266 f.</a>, above), prevented the earlier events from
actually being represented upon the stage. There was, therefore,
a considerable body of facts which the poet had either to relate
frankly and succinctly in a mass at the beginning or to attempt
to weave into the play and disclose gradually as they were
needed. Euripides preferred the former method, which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
employed in all of his extant plays except possibly the <i>Iphigenia
at Aulis</i>. It was borrowed by Sophocles in his <i>Maidens of
Trachis</i>, was extensively imitated by Aristophanes despite his
caustic criticisms, and was exceedingly popular among the
writers of New Comedy. Even in modern times, notwithstanding
all that has been said against it both by ancients and moderns,
there have always been playwrights to whom this manner of
approach has made the stronger appeal. The principle involved
is well stated by a contemporaneous student of dramatic technique:<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
“It may not unreasonably be contended, I think, that,
when an exposition cannot be thoroughly dramatized—that is,
wrung out, in the stress of the action, from the characters primarily
concerned—it may best be dismissed, rapidly and even
conventionally, by any not too improbable device.”</p>

<p>Frequently the opening soliloquy of the prologue was spoken
by a divinity, and in Euripides’ <i>Hecabe</i> it is spoken by a ghost!
Their prophetic powers enabled such personages to predict the
course of the action. Thus in Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i> (vss. 42 ff.),
Aphrodite declares that Phaedra’s love for her stepson will be
made known to his father, whose curses will bring Hippolytus to
destruction, and that Phaedra herself will die, though with name
untarnished; and these things actually come to pass in the play.
Indeed, an outstanding difference between ancient and modern
tragedy, doubtless arising from the fact that the former dealt
with traditional material whose outlines were fairly well known
to at least some and could be modified only within certain limits,
consists in this, that the Greek tragedians usually made little
or no attempt to keep their audiences in the dark as to the outcome.
It is true that there are occasional exceptions. For
example, in Euripides’ <i>Ion</i>, Hermes explains in the prologue that
Apollo is Ion’s father by a secret union, but expressly states that
the Delphian deity will bring the youth into his just deserts
without letting his own misdeed become known. Consequently
when Ion’s very life seems to depend upon his parentage transpiring,
the hearts of the spectators are harried with fear for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
safety until Athena appears in her brother’s stead as deus ex
machina and unexpectedly reveals his secret after all. Euripides’
<i>Orestes</i> provides another instance of an attempt to baffle the
spectators. The contrast of a few such cases, however, serve
only to call attention to the more usual procedure. Here again
the Greek practice has not lacked defenders. Lessing wrote:<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
“I am far removed from believing with the majority of those who
have written on the dramatic art that the dénouement should
be hid from the spectator. I rather think it would not exceed
my powers to rouse the very strongest interest in the spectator
even if I resolved to make a work where the dénouement was
revealed in the first scene. Everything must be clear for the
spectator, he is the confidant of each person, he knows everything
that occurs, everything that has occurred, and there are hundreds
of instances when we cannot do better than to tell him straight
out what is going to occur.” A somewhat different point of view
is presented by Professor Murray:<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> “But why does the prologue
let out the secret of what is coming? Why does it spoil the
excitement beforehand? Because, we must answer, there is no
secret, and the poet does not aim at that sort of excitement.
A certain amount of plot-interest there certainly is: we are never
told exactly what will happen but only what sort of thing; or
we are told what will happen but not how it will happen. But
the enjoyment which the poet aims at is not the enjoyment of
reading a detective story for the first time; it is that of reading
<i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Paradise Lost</i> for the second or fifth or tenth.”</p>

<p>But the prologue was not always spoken by a divinity;
oftentimes a mortal appeared in this capacity. Sometimes this
mortal took no further part in the dramatic action, and sometimes
he did. In the latter case he occasionally displayed as prologist
a greater knowledge of the situation and of what was going to
happen than he afterward seemed to possess as an acting character.
This difficulty occurs in Plautus’ <i>Braggart Captain</i>.
At vss. 145 ff. (in the prologue) Palaestrio boasts how he will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
cause his fellow-slave “not to see what he has seen” and even
explains the trick which will be used for this purpose. But in the
scene following the prologue, when he must make good his
braggadocio, he seems as perplexed and confounded as would
one who had not foreseen this emergency.</p>

<p>In later times the soliloquy of the prologist was sometimes
deferred until after an introductory scene or two. Such “internal”
prologues occur in the <i>Casket</i> and the <i>Braggart Captain</i> of
Plautus. The meager beginnings of this system can be traced
in Aristophanes and Euripides, but there is no evidence for its
full development prior to the time of Alexis, a poet of Middle
Comedy. His nephew, Menander, who belonged to the New
Comedy, employed it in his <i>Hero</i> and <i>Girl with Shorn Locks</i>. In
Plautus’ <i>Amphitruo</i>, Mercury speaks an opening prologue (vss.
1-152), then engages in a dialogue with Sosia (vss. 153-462),
after which he continues the prologue for some thirty additional
verses!</p>

<p>The six comedies of Terence all begin with “dissociated”
prologues. These give the name and Greek authorship of the
Latin play and bespeak the friendly consideration of the audience.
They devote no attention, however, to the dramatic situation
in the comedy or to future complications therein, but are
employed for polemical purposes against the poet’s detractors.
It used to be supposed that this was an absolutely new departure
on Terence’s part, but it is now found to be only the last in a
series of developments which began in Greek comedy.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>Of course monologues were not the invention of the playwrights,
being found as early as Homer. Yet true soliloquies, as
seen in Shakespeare, are a late development in Greek drama.
The epic hero, when alone, may appeal to some divinity or the
elements, or he may address his own soul; he never simply thinks
his thoughts out loud. So long as the tragedies began with a
parodus the choreutae would nearly always be present; and a
character who was otherwise alone could address his remarks to
them. Consequently no monologues occur in either the <i>Suppliants</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
or the <i>Persians</i> of Aeschylus. But with the introduction
of a prologue the way was opened up. It would be interesting
to know how the words of the eunuch at the beginning of Phrynichus’
<i>Phoenician Women</i> were motivated, but no evidence is
available. In the extant plays of Aeschylus only three soliloquies
are found—in the <i>Prometheus Bound</i> (vss. 88 ff.), <i>Agamemnon</i>
(vss. 1 ff.), and <i>Eumenides</i> (vss. 1 ff.). The first is addressed
to the elements (ether, breezes, rivers, ocean, earth, and sun) and
the other two begin with prayer. There are also some other
speeches which are delivered in the presence of the chorus or of
another character but with little or no reference thereto. If
completely detached, however, they are addressed to divinities
as before. It must be added that though monologues in Aeschylus
and other tragedians may be thus motivated at the beginning,
they frequently trail off into expressions which are not strictly
appropriate. It is noticeable, then, that of the two types of
motivation found in Homer only the first occurs in Aeschylus.
In Sophocles the situation is practically the same.</p>

<p>But already in the oldest of Euripides’ extant tragedies, the
<i>Alcestis</i>, a development may be detected. Apollo’s monologue
at the beginning of this play has just been discussed. It is
apparent that when a divinity utters a soliloquy he would rarely
address his words to some absent deity or to the elements, as
mortal personages did in Aeschylus and Sophocles. This factor
helps to account for the fact that dramatic illusion suffers here.
For all practical purposes Apollo might just as well have frankly
addressed himself to the spectators, as the comic poets sometimes
allowed their characters to do. Such prologizing deities
are careful to explain the reason for their presence in the place
where we find them; but they are absolved from the necessity of
accounting for their soliloquizing. Their speeches sometimes
degenerate into business-like notices which are almost brusque
in their abruptness. For example, Posidon begins Euripides’
<i>Trojan Women</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I come, Posidon I, from briny depths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the Aegean Sea, where Nereids dance, etc.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">This new freedom, which thus came first to divine prologists,
was soon extended also to mortals. Thus the heroine in Euripides’
<i>Andromache</i> exclaims (vss. 1 ff.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The artificiality of Euripides’ opening soliloquies strikingly
appears in his <i>Orestes</i>. Referring to Clytemnestra’s murder of
her husband, Electra says (vss. 26 f.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherefore she slew,—a shame for maid to speak!—</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These words, together with certain other phrases, show clearly
that the speaker is conscious of an audience.</p>

<p>It will be worth our while to note and comment also upon the
other monologues in the <i>Alcestis</i> and the first one in the <i>Medea</i>,
these being the oldest of Euripides’ extant tragedies. At vss.
243 ff. the dying Alcestis, in the presence of her husband and
the chorus and interrupted by the former at regular intervals,
bids a final farewell to sun, earth, palace, etc. This belongs to
the type found in Homer and Aeschylus and is paralleled by
Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i> (vss. 806 ff.) and <i>Ajax</i> (vss. 372 ff.). At
vs. 746 of the <i>Alcestis</i> occurs one of the few instances of a chorus
retiring during the course of a Greek play. Advantage is at
once taken of this circumstance. A reason for the servant’s
leaving the palace at this point can readily be imagined but none
is expressly mentioned. Nor is the bluntness of his monologue
softened by any motivation. At vs. 773 Heracles appears and a
dialogue ensues between them. At vs. 837 the servant withdraws;
Heracles tarries and bursts forth as follows (incidentally
obviating in this way the necessity of their departures in opposite
directions exactly synchronizing):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O much-enduring heart and hand of mine, etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It will be observed that such an introduction for the following
soliloquy is a reversion to the second Homeric type, which now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
makes its first appearance in tragedy. At vs. 861 Admetus
re-enters with the chorus and apostrophizes his bereaved palace.
His speech at vs. 934 begins with the words “my friends,”
referring to the chorus, and closes in the same way at vs. 961.
Except for these artificial sutures his words constitute in effect a
soliloquy. This play is especially valuable for our present
purpose as indicating what a hindrance the chorus was to the
unhampered use of monologues outside of the prologue, and how
quickly and freely they were called into requisition during its
withdrawal. The same deduction may be drawn also from
comedy. In the Old Comedy of Aristophanes, the chorus still
being active and vigorous, soliloquies were employed hardly
more freely than in Aeschylus or Sophocles. But by the time
of New Comedy, when the chorus had so far lost its functions
as to appear only for <i>entr’actes</i> and when Euripides’ innovations
had had time to work their full effect, monologues occur
with great frequency and are usually unmotived. In fact,
Professor Leo endeavored to use them in the plays of Plautus
and Terence, which are taken from originals of the Greek
New Comedy, as a criterion to determine the position of act
divisions.</p>

<p>From the <i>Medea</i> I wish to cite only the opening monologue,
which is spoken by the Colchian’s nurse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Would God that Argo’s hull had never flown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through those blue Clashing Rocks to Colchis-land,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">An admirable quality here is the passionate emotion which does
not always dominate Greek soliloquies. A little later (vs. 49) a
man slave enters and inquires:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O ancient chattel of my mistress’ home,</div>

    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is noteworthy, however, that despite this statement her opening
monologue had not in fact been addressed to earth or sky.
Since Ibsen the soliloquy has been tabooed on the modern stage.
Yet inasmuch as people do at times talk aloud, when alone, it
would seem that the present-day reaction had gone too far and
that monologues, under proper psychological conditions, might
sometimes be allowed. Furthermore it must be supposed that
among impulsive southern races, like the Greeks and Romans,
soliloquizing would be more common than with us, and in consequence
it would naturally claim a larger part in their drama.
Nevertheless, we have seen that, until Euripides, the playwrights
restricted its use to such instances as could be motivated with
some degree of naturalness. Of these motives it must be allowed
that the least satisfactory was that founded on an appeal to the
elements. Of course most commentators have refused to recognize
this as a mere expository convention and have expatiated
upon the innate feeling for and sympathy with nature among the
Greeks. But as for myself I fear that this explanation has been
pressed unduly. Euripides, I am sure, felt self-conscious in
utilizing a device so threadbare and patent. My conviction is
based on the retroactive way in which he employed the motive
here in the <i>Medea</i>, on the fact that he often preferred to introduce
monologues without any motive than to resort to one so bald
and artificial as this, and especially on the guilty phrase which he
slips into the heroine’s soliloquy in his <i>Iphigenia among the
Taurians</i> (vss. 42 f.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What visions strange the night hath brought to me</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Though it is unsafe to set too much value upon the jibes of the
comic poets, yet it is not without interest to observe their attitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
in this matter. Philemon placed a close parody of this <i>Medea</i>
passage in the mouth of a boastful cook:<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">And tell to earth and heaven—my cuisinerie!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Plautus in his <i>Merchant</i> (vss. 3 ff.) preserved a more explicit
passage from the same poet of New Comedy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I do not do as I’ve seen others do</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Tell night, day, sun, or moon their miseries.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The foregoing statement of Euripidean usage is far from
exhaustive. Yet it is necessary to hasten on. Quite apart
from the effects which may be secured from monologues in
choral drama, there are no less than three additional uses to
which they can easily be put in chorusless plays. In terms of
classical drama, therefore, they will appear most frequently in
Greek New Comedy and in Plautus and Terence.</p>

<p>In the first place when two characters meet on the stage and
talk it is necessary for them either to appear simultaneously at
the two entrances (and it is self-evident that this method cannot
be employed very often without seeming ridiculous) or for
one of them to enter first and fill up a slight interval before the
other’s arrival by soliloquizing. Such an entrance monologue
occurs at the beginning of Aristophanes’ <i>Lysistrata</i>, where the
bearer of the title-rôle complains:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now were they summoned to some shrine of Bacchus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pan, Colias, or Genetyllis, there had been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No room to stir, so thick the crowd of timbrels.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now!—there’s not one woman to be seen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stay, here comes one, my neighbor Calonice.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good morning, friend.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Rogers’ translation]</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps I may be pardoned for digressing here a moment in
order to discuss what happens when two characters make a
simultaneous introit through the same entrance. In most cases
it is natural to suppose that they have been together for some
little while and that some talk has already been carried on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
between them. On the contrary in the fifth-century plays the
conversation regularly does not begin until after they have
entered the stage. Two instances of this have already been noted
on <a href="#Page_259">pages 259 f.</a>, above, Orestes coming all the way from Phocis
to Argos before he acquaints his associates with the Delphian
oracle or formulates a plan of action with them, and Iris accompanying
Madness from Olympus but reserving her instructions
until Thebes has been reached. Of course it is easy to see why
this convention was employed, but a little thinking enabled the
playwrights to secure the same results without violating verisimilitude
quite so patently. Only twice in fifth-century drama
do characters enter with words which indicate that they have
already been engaged in conversation. In Aristophanes’ <i>Frogs</i>
(405 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) (vs. 830), Euripides says to Dionysus, as they emerge
with Pluto from the latter’s palace: “I would not yield the
throne of tragedy to Aeschylus; do not urge me to.” Again in
Euripides’ posthumous <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i> (vss. 303 ff.), Agamemnon’s
slave enters in expostulation: “Menelaus, outrageous is
your boldness.... You ought not to have unsealed the tablet
which I bore.” The former of these quotations clearly implies
words off scene, and the latter implies action and presumably
words as well. But in New Comedy and the Latin comedies
this technique has, not unnaturally, pre-empted the field. Two
instances must suffice. In Terence’s version of Menander’s
<i>Andrian Girl</i> (vss. 820 f.), Chremes enters complaining: “My
friendship for you, Simo, has already been put sufficiently to the
test; I have run enough risk. Now make an end of coaxing
me.” Again, in Terence’s <i>Brothers</i> (vs. 517), Ctesipho and Syrus
enter together, the former saying: “You say my father has gone
to the country?” It is characteristic of this technique that the
very first words make plain the fact that the stage conversation
is a continuation of one already begun off stage and likewise
disclose the topic under discussion. It will be remembered that
simultaneous entrances of this sort, when made from the abode
of one of the characters involved, are generally left unmotivated
(see <a href="#Page_239">p. 239</a>, above).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>After this digression we may return to the second use which
New Comedy made of monologues, viz., as exit speeches. Since
there was no drop curtain in the Greek theater, all characters
had to go off as well as come on; no tableau effects to terminate
a scene were possible. Moreover, in order to avoid the simultaneous
exit of all the persons in a scene, it often seemed best
to detain one of them beyond the rest and allow him to fill a
brief interval with a soliloquy. As already mentioned this
technique occurs so frequently in Plautus and Terence that an
attempt has been made to utilize it as a criterion for a division
of the Roman comedies into acts. Such an exit soliloquy has
already been noted in Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i>, vss. 837 ff. (<a href="#Page_306">p. 306</a>,
above).</p>

<p>In the third place, unless a new character is to enter the stage
at the very instant that an old one leaves it, the actor who engages
in successive dialogue with each of them must cause a slight
pause by soliloquizing. Such a soliloquy is technically known
as a “link.” One is found in the monologue which Strepsiades
utters between the withdrawal of his son and the entrance of
Socrates’ pupil (Aristophanes’ <i>Clouds</i>, vss. 126 ff.). Links are
often extremely short, sometimes being no more than a cough or
hem; they are frequently employed to cover the condensation
of time, especially when they occur between the exit
and re-entrance of the same character. Furthermore, they
occur in playwrights who reject other forms of soliloquy, no
less than five instances appearing in Ibsen’s <i>Pillars of Society</i>
alone.</p>

<p>So long as the chorus retained its vigor, dramatists found it
easier, except in the prologue or during occasional withdrawals
of the chorus in the course of the action, to fill gaps by remarks
addressed to the coryphaeus than by entrance soliloquies, exit
soliloquies, or links. Yet they do occur in choral drama, and
I have cited one instance illustrative of each type from fifth-century
plays. In comedies of subsequent date, in which the
chorus was greatly curtailed or nonexistent, they may be found
by the score.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>It still remains to speak of another kind of soliloquy, viz., the
aside or, more accurately speaking, the apart, by which the grim
ghastliness of modern tragedy has often been enhanced. The
vastness of Greek theaters and the almost constant presence
of from twelve to twenty-four choreutae rendered this artifice
an awkward one for ancient playwrights. Nevertheless, asides
are occasionally found in Greek drama. In Euripides’ <i>Hippolytus</i>
(vss. 1060 ff.), that hero, unable to clear himself of false
accusations except by violating his oath of secrecy, exclaims to
himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Gods, why can I not unlock my lips,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who am destroyed by you whom I revere?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No!—whom I need persuade, I should not so,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all for nought should break the oaths I swore.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[Way’s translation],</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">entirely unheard by his father and the chorus close at hand.
Half-asides occur in Euripides’ <i>Hecabe</i> (vss. 736-51), where the
Trojan queen utters no less than four aparts, an aggregate of ten
verses, in an effort to decide whether to appeal to Agamemnon
for aid. His interruptions indicate that he is aware that she is
speaking but does not catch the drift of her words. It should
be noted, however, that these passages do not contain the ironic
values which have usually inhered in the use of aparts upon the
modern stage. The obstacles hampering the employment of
asides in fifth-century times appear most plainly from scenes like
Euripides’ <i>Ion</i> (vss. 1520 ff.), where two actors wish to speak
to one another privately. Their confidences must be uttered
loud enough to be heard by the seventeen thousand spectators,
but the nearby chorus catches not a word. With the virtual
disappearance of the chorus in New Comedy the apart, not
unnaturally, came into more frequent use and was employed
more as it has been in modern times.</p>

<p>For the absence of ironic aparts, however, Greek tragedy was
richly compensated by the frequent occurrence of dramatic irony.
Irony of course is a mode of speech by means of which is conveyed
a meaning contrary to the literal sense of the words, and may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
be divided into two classes—“verbal” and “practical” (to use
Bishop Thirlwall’s term) or “dramatic.” In the former the
dissimulation is manifest to all concerned, else the sarcasm,
passing unrecognized, would fail of its effect and recoil upon the
speaker, while in the latter (which alone interests us here)
concealment of the hinted truth is essential. It may be the
speaker himself who fails to perceive the inner meaning of his own
words (and then we call it “objective” irony), or he may employ
“subjective” irony, i.e., consciously use his superior knowledge,
to gloat over his victim or inveigle him to doom by an ambiguous
utterance. In either case, however, the <i>double entente</i> is usually
known to the audience, a considerable part of whose pleasure
consists in viewing with prophetic insight the abortive efforts
of the dramatic characters to escape the impending catastrophe.</p>

<p>An excellent instance of conscious irony occurs in Middleton
and Rowley’s <i>Changeling</i>, Act III, scene 2. There De Flores is
guiding Alonzo about the castle where he intends to murder him,
and significantly says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All this is nothing; you shall see anon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A place you little dream on.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The unconscious irony, however, is likely to be more tragic in its
tone. So when Iago first conceives his groundless suspicions of
his wife and Othello he vows that he will be</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">evened with him, wife for wife.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse right">[<i>Othello</i>, Act II, scene 2],</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and these words are fulfilled in a sense far different than he
intended, by the death of both wives. For this sort of irony
Sophocles was especially renowned, and his <i>Oedipus the King</i>
abounds in instances. One must suffice. Oedipus has slain
his own father, the reigning king, though these facts are unknown
to him. Being now directed by an oracle to investigate his
predecessor’s death, he declares, with more meaning than he
realized: “I will fight this battle for him as for mine own sire”
(vss. 264).</p>

<p>It is possible to draw still one more distinction. Dramatic
irony consists, not only in the contrast between the outer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
apparent meaning and the real, inner meaning of an ambiguous
phrase, but also in the contrast between the real and the supposed
situation. Thus a man whose ruin is impending often mistakes
the position of his affairs so utterly as to indulge in entirely
unjustified expressions, feelings, gestures, or acts of rejoicing
and triumph. The difference between these two varieties of
dramatic irony may be seen in Sophocles’ <i>Maidens of Trachis</i>.
In the first place we have the contradiction between the real
meaning of the oracle that Heracles’ “release from toils will be
accomplished” and Heracles’ own mistaken interpretation
thereof (vss. 167 f. and 1170 ff.); and in the second place there
is the “irony of situation” in that Deianira sends him a gift
which she hopes will woo back his love but which actually
results in his death. Euripides’ <i>Bacchanals</i> offers other examples
in the boastful and confident attitude of Pentheus, whom the
spectators know to be doomed to a frightful end, and in the
mock humility of Dionysus, whose intended vengeance they
foresee. Again, in Sophocles’ <i>Oedipus the King</i> (vss. 1014 ff.)
there is a striking contrast between the intended and the actual
effect when the Corinthian messenger informs Oedipus that
Polybus was not his father. This irony of situation often consists
in the clash or shock of conflicting intrigues, as may be seen in
Shakespeare’s <i>Measure for Measure</i>.</p>

<p>But dramatic irony was not confined to tragedy, as a brief
analysis of one of Terence’s plays will disclose. In comedy,
however, the effect was naturally somewhat different, being more
humorous than tragic. In the <i>Andrian Girl</i>, Simo intrigues to
test his son’s obedience, pretending that he has arranged an
immediate marriage for him with Chremes’ daughter. Accordingly
there is irony of situation in the consternation which this
false announcement causes (vss. 236 ff. and 301 ff.). Pamphilus’
slave (Davus), however, soon sees through the trick and persuades
him to turn back the intrigue (and, consequently, the
irony) upon his father by apparent compliance (vss. 420 ff.).
But Simo at once proceeds to get Chremes’ consent in fact, so
that the dramatic situation is again reversed, as the too clever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
slave discovers to his surprise when he facetiously inquires why
the wedding is being delayed (vss. 581 ff.). Especially galling
are Simo’s words (said without a full comprehension of how true
they are): “Now I beseech you, Davus, since you alone have
brought about this marriage ... exert yourself further that
my son be brought into line” (vss. 595 f.). There is also irony in
the conduct of Charinus, who is a suitor for Chremes’ daughter
and is naturally (though needlessly) disturbed at the thought of
Pamphilus’ marrying her (vss. 301 ff., 625 ff., and 957 ff.). Of
course there is always irony involved when a man leads himself
astray or allows another so to lead him; but as these are the
standard themes of comedy, one need not cite every such
instance.</p>

<p>The best instance in this play, however, can be appreciated
only on second reading or as the memory of the spectator recalls
its real significance. Simo wishes his son to marry Chremes’
daughter, but Pamphilus’ affections are already pledged elsewhere.
Now unknown to all the parties concerned this sweetheart
is also Chremes’ daughter. There is, therefore, more
meaning than he intends or perceives in Pamphilus’ despairing
question: “Can I in no way avoid relationship with Chremes?”
(vs. 247).</p>

<p>This is similar to Admetus’ words in Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i>
(vs. 1102) when Heracles insists that he receive into his home a
veiled woman (really Admetus’ own wife restored to life):
“Would you had never won her in a wrestling bout!” But in
the present instance the identity of Pamphilus’ mistress does
not transpire until later, so that, as I have stated, the irony is
not at first apparent. There is here a point of difference between
tragedy and comedy in antiquity: the themes of tragedy were
almost invariably drawn from mythology and the outlines of the
story would therefore be known to practically everyone of
consequence in the audience; furthermore, the not infrequent
practice of foretelling the dénouement in the prologue would put
even the ignorant in a position to recognize subtleties in the
language of the characters. That the ancient playwrights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
themselves appreciated this difference appears from the words
of the comic poet, Antiphanes, already quoted on <a href="#Page_127">page 127</a>,
above. As a result, in ancient tragedy the irony of a situation
or ambiguous phrase would be recognized at once without any
preparation for it whatsoever, while in ancient comedy and in
modern plays, whether tragic or comic, these effects usually have
to be led up to. Two other considerations ought also to be
mentioned, however. First, audiences exercise a sort of clairvoyance
in looking beneath the bare words and divining the
course of events, so that (paradoxical at it sounds) the surprises
of the stage usually are long foreseen by the spectators and only
the expected events happen. Secondly, the dénouement here
in question, the discovery that Pamphilus’ sweetheart is the
daughter of free parents and, in particular, of someone among the
dramatis personae, was so hackneyed in New Comedy, occurring
in no less than five of Terence’s six plays, that any frequent
theatergoer would have been on the lookout for it and might
easily have recognized any subtle effects dependent thereon.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we have to consider the dramatic purpose of
tragic irony and its effect upon the audience. Bishop Thirlwall
(<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 489) pointed out:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is always a slight cast of irony in the grave, calm, respectful
attention impartially bestowed by an intelligent judge on two contending
parties, who are pleading their causes before him with all the earnestness
of deep conviction, and of excited feeling. What makes the contrast
interesting is, that the right and the truth lie on neither side exclusively:
that there is no fraudulent purpose, no gross imbecility of intellect, on either:
but both have plausible claims and specious reasons to allege, though each
is too much blinded by prejudice or passion to do justice to the views of his
adversary. For here the irony lies not in the demeanor of the judge, but is
deeply seated in the case itself, which seems to favor both of the litigants,
but really eludes them both.</p>

</div>

<p>This analogy is especially true when the irony arises from
clashing intrigues, and the audience, admitted to the author’s
confidence and sitting at his side, as it were, joins with him in
awarding praise here and condemnation there. Again the playwright
is the omnipotent creator and ruler of the little world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
that moves upon the stage. And the spectator, beholding the
dramatic characters’ fruitless toil and plotting, baseless exultation,
and needless despondency seems to be admitted behind the
scenes of this world’s tragedy and to view the spectacle through
the great dramatist’s eyes, learning that man must be content
with little, humble ever, distrustful of fortune, and fearful of the
powers above. Thus the slighter themes and less important
reverses of comedy bring a purification (κάθαρσις) in their train
no less truly than the more somber catastrophes of tragedy.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>The technical word used of bringing out a play was διδάσκειν
(“to teach”), and the technical name for the director of the
performance was <i>didascalus</i> (διδάσκαλος) or “teacher.” We
have already noted (<a href="#Page_198">p. 198</a>, above) that <i>didascalia</i> (διδασκαλία;
“teaching”) was the name for a group of plays brought out by a
tragic playwright at one time, and the same word was applied
to a record of the theatrical contests. At the beginning the
didascalus and the author were identical, for the reason that the
primitive poets taught the choreutae what they were to sing,
that the poets in the one-actor period carried the histrionic parts
themselves and still taught the choreutae their rôles, and that
even when they had ceased to act in their plays they yet
continued to train those who did.</p>

<p>The Athenian archons seem to have kept records of the
contests at the Dionysiac festivals, the archon eponymus for
the City Dionysia and the king archon for the Lenaea. These
records, of course, were not compiled in the interests of literary
research such as flourished in Alexandrian times but merely for
the private convenience of the officials and for documentary
purposes. Apparently they consisted of a bald series of entries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
chronicling the choregi, tribes, poet-didascali, actors, plays, and
victors in the various dithyrambic and dramatic events. In
the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> these archives were published by Aristotle
in a work entitled <i>Didascaliae</i>. His service probably was
mainly that of unearthing the material and arranging it in
chronological sequence and of making it available to a wider
public, for Dr. Jachmann has made it seem clear that he did not
edit the archons’ record to any great extent. In consequence
Aristotle’s book contained too much and was overloaded with
unimportant details. Its main value consisted in being a court
of last resort and a source from which smaller and less unwieldy
lists might be compiled.</p>

<p>Some of these indirect products of Aristotle’s industry were
entered upon stone and are still preserved in fragments. The
first of these is for convenience referred to as the Fasti (“calendar”
or “register”) and contained the annual victors in each
event at the City Dionysia from about 502/1 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> when volunteer
comuses were first given a place in the festival program. This
inscription was cut upon the face of a wall built of four rows of
superimposed blocks and almost six feet in height. The text
was arranged in vertical columns. There were originally sixteen
of these and most of them contained one hundred and forty-one
lines. The presence of a heading over the first five columns,
however, reduced the lines upon them to one hundred and forty.
For the most part the lines in adjoining columns were placed
exactly opposite one another, but toward the bottom of col. 13
the writing was crowded so that this column perhaps contained
no less than one hundred and fifty-three lines. As the entries
for 346-342 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> fell in this space, most authorities accept
Dr. Wilhelm’s conclusion that the body of the inscription was
cut at that period and received additional entries, year by year,
for subsequent festivals until about 319 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Whoever was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
responsible for the original inscription must have excerpted the
appropriate items from Aristotle’s <i>Didascaliae</i> and, for the brief
period intervening between the publication of Aristotle’s book
and 346-342 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, from the original archives.</p>

<p>The character of the Fasti will appear most clearly from
Fig. 75,<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> a transcript and restoration of two fragments on which
were originally cut the tops of cols. 3-5. The Greek letters
within brackets are restorations where the stone is broken away
or illegible. Inasmuch as the entries follow a fixed order from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
year to year and occupy a definite number of lines, except as
slight changes were occasionally introduced into the program, it
is often easy to restore everything but proper names. Of the
heading of the inscription, which extended over the first five
columns, only the center is preserved. When complete it
probably read somewhat as follows: οἵδε νενικήκασιν ... ἀφ’
οὗ πρῶτ]ον κῶμοι ἦσαν τῶ[ι Διονύσωι Ἐλευθερεῖ (“The following
gained the victory ... since first there were comuses in
honor of Dionysus Eleuthereus”). Let us examine more closely
the record of the year which begins at line nine in the second
column of <a href="#figure75">Fig. 75</a> (col. 4 in the complete inscription). The
entries for each year begin with ἐπί (“in the time of”), followed
by the name of the Athenian archon eponymus in the genitive
case. The archon for this year was Philocles, whose term ran
from July, 459 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, to July, 458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Since the festivals came
in the spring the record under consideration is for the City
Dionysia of 458 <span class="allsmcap">B.C</span>. The inscription is so formulaic and condensed
that it has necessarily been expanded somewhat in the
following translation:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the archonship of Philocles.</li>
<li class="isub1">The tribe Oeneis was victorious with a dithyrambic chorus of boys;</li>
<li class="isub1">Demodocus was choregus.</li>
<li class="isub1">The tribe Hippothontis was victorious with a dithyrambic chorus of men;</li>
<li class="isub1">Euctemon of Eleusis was choregus.</li>
<li class="isub1">In the contest of comedians:</li>
<li class="isub1">Euryclides was choregus,</li>
<li class="isub1">Euphronius was didascalus.</li>
<li class="isub1">In the contest of tragedians:</li>
<li class="isub1">Xenocles of Aphidnae was choregus,</li>
<li class="isub1">Aeschylus was didascalus.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was the year in which Aeschylus competed in Athens for
the last time and was victorious with his Orestean trilogy.</p>

<p>About 278 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> two other inscriptions were compiled from
Aristotle’s publication of theatrical records. I refer to the
stone Didascaliae and to the Victors’-Lists. The former gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
the full program of the dramatic, but not the dithyrambic,
events for each year and fell into four divisions, dealing respectively
with tragedy and with
comedy at each of the two
festivals. <a href="#figure76a">Fig. 76<i>a</i></a><a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> gives a
transcript of two fragments
which reproduce the programs
of tragedy at the City
Dionysia in 341 and 340 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>

<p>There are several matters
here which are worthy of comment.
It will be noted that
by 341 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the tragic poets
no longer closed each group of
plays with a satyric drama,
but one satyr-play was performed
instead as a preface
to the tragic contest. It followed
that the playwrights,
the number of whose dramas
now corresponded to that of
the star performers, were no
longer handicapped by being
allotted the exclusive services
of a single star and his troupe
but were placed upon terms
of perfect equality by having
all the stars in turn at their
command, each for a different
tragedy. This explains why
in 340 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when we must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
suppose that three players of the first rank with their supporting
companies were for some reason not available, the
number of tragedies presented by each playwright was likewise
reduced to two and the histrionic talent was thus kept evenly
distributed. The fact that the tragic writers no longer devoted
whole trilogies to different aspects of the same theme made
it easy to reduce the number of tragedies in any year in
order to conform to an emergency in the histrionic conditions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
Furthermore, old tragedies were not now permitted to compete
with new ones, as was said to have been the practice in the case of
Aeschylus’ plays after his decease (see <a href="#Page_203">p. 203</a>, above); but beginning
at the City Dionysia of 386 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, as we learn from the Fasti,
an old tragedy was performed, outside of the contest, every year.
It is interesting to observe that in both these years and again in
339 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (see next to the last line in <a href="#figure76a">Fig. 76<i>a</i></a>) plays of Euripides
were chosen for this purpose, and this is in accord with the steady
growth of that poet’s popularity as compared with Aeschylus
and Sophocles. As already stated, the Didascaliae were inscribed
in 278 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, but the record was kept up to date by contemporaneous
entries for over a century subsequently.</p>

<p>The Victors’-Lists were prepared at the same time as the
stone Didascaliae and were likewise derived from Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> but
they were very different in character. They recorded the aggregate
of victories won by poets and actors in tragedy and comedy
at each of the two festivals—eight lists in all. I shall content
myself with citing one fragment from the list of tragic poets
who were victorious at the City Dionysia (cf. <a href="#figure77a">Fig. 77 <i>a</i></a> and
<a href="#figure77b"><i>b</i></a>).<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
The names were arranged in the chronological order of their
first victory at the festival in question, in this case the City
Dionysia; and after each name was entered the total number of
victories gained at that festival. We are especially interested
in two names in this list, Aeschylus and Sophocles. Of course
the former’s name did not originally head the list; it stood in the
eleventh line. The numeral is broken away from behind his
name, but we know from other sources that he won thirteen
(ΔΙΙΙ) victories. He died before the establishment of the
tragic contest at the Lenaea, so that his competition was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
restricted to the City Dionysia. But Suidas reports that according
to some Aeschylus had gained twenty-eight victories.
Perhaps the larger number is not to be rejected as worthless
but is to be regarded as including the victories which Aeschylus’
plays are said to have won after his decease in competition, at
both festivals, with the works of living tragedians. To Sophocles
the inscription assigns eighteen (ΔΓΙΙΙ) victories at the City
Dionysia, and that is the number which most authorities give.
But Suidas, who regularly records the aggregate of victories at
both festivals, credits him with twenty-four victories. Sophocles
must, therefore, have been victorious six times at the Lenaea.
Euripides’ name does not appear upon any extant portion of the
Victors’-List. He is usually stated to have won five victories,
but some notices report fifteen. Possibly we are to understand
that he won ten Lenaean victories. His comparative lack of
success while living thus stands in striking contrast to his
popularity subsequently.</p>

<p>Dr. Reisch has propounded an ingenious and plausible theory
with reference to the housing of the Didascaliae and the Victors’-Lists
(cf. <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 302 ff.). He believes that these catalogues
were prepared for the master of contests (the agonothete, see
<a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>, above) for the year 278 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, who also erected a special
structure in the precinct of Dionysus Eleuthereus to receive
them. The dedicatory inscription is extant, but unfortunately
the name of the agonothete is broken away. He supposes this
building to have been hexagonal, with three sides of solid wall
and the other three left open. This arrangement was designed
to afford a maximum of light for reading the inscriptions on the
interior of the building. On the left wall, as one passed through
the main entrance, were cut the tragic Didascaliae of the City
Dionysia. On the architrave above was the Victors’-List for
the tragic poets at this festival, and on the architrave over the
adjoining (open) side to the right was the Victors’-List for the
tragic actors. On the next wall to the right were the comic
Didascaliae of the City Dionysia, and on the architrave above
that side and the adjoining (open) one were the Victors’-Lists of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
the comic poets and actors who had won victories at this festival.
On the third wall stood both the comic and also the tragic
Didascaliae of the Lenaea. On the architrave above this wall
were the Victors’-Lists of the comic poets and actors at the Lenaea,
and on the architrave above the sixth (open) side were those of
the tragic poets and actors at the same festival. Dr. Reisch’s
reconstruction may be incorrect in some minor details, but must
certainly be accepted in principle.</p>

<p>One matter in connection with all these inscriptions has been
a subject of keen controversy among scholars, and the end is
not yet. The problem is too complicated to be discussed upon
its merits here, but the general situation may be outlined. When
a poet did not serve as his own didascalus but brought out his
play through someone else, did the name of the didascalus or
that of the poet appear in the records? On a few points general
agreement is possible. For example, when a poet had applied
for a chorus in his own name but died before the festival and
someone else had to assume his didascalic duties, care seems to
have been taken at all periods to indicate the original didascalus.
Again, in cases of deliberate deception, as when a man without
dramatic powers secured the consent of a playwright to bring
out the latter’s work as his own and applied for a chorus as if
for his own play, naturally the name of the pseudo-author would
be the only one to appear in the records. The crucial case
remains, viz., when a dramatist wished to be relieved of the
burden of stage management and arranged for a didascalus to
ask for a chorus and assume responsibility for the performance.
The matter becomes important with reference to Aristophanes
and the correct restoration of the Victors’-Lists for comic poets
at the City Dionysia and the Lenaea.</p>

<p>When Aristophanes had written his first play, the <i>Banqueters</i>,
youth, inexperience, diffidence, or some other motive for desiring
to avoid the responsibility of staging his play caused him to
intrust it to Callistratus for production at the Lenaea of 427 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
The same process was repeated at the City Dionysia of 426 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
and the Lenaea of 425 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when Callistratus brought out Aristophanes’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
<i>Babylonians</i> and <i>Acharnians</i>, respectively. The
former piece was apparently unsuccessful, but the latter was
awarded the first prize. At the Lenaea of 424 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Aristophanes
was equally successful with the <i>Knights</i>, which, however, he
produced <i>in his own name</i>. In vss. 512 ff. of this play the chorus
declares that many Athenians approached the poet and expressed
their surprise that he had not long before asked for a chorus
in his own name. This passage implies that the real authorship
of Aristophanes’ earlier pieces was known to a large section of
the public, and makes it clear that he had produced no earlier
plays in his own name. Therefore if he had won a City victory
during this period the comedy with which he won it must have
been brought out in the name of another. The earliest City
Dionysia, then, at which he could have produced a play in his
own name was in 424 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, two months later than the <i>Knights</i>.
Now in the Victors’-List for comic poets at the City Dionysia
(<a href="#figure78">Fig. 78</a>),<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> the letters Ἀρι appear in line seven of the second
column. Is the name of Aristophanes or that of Aristomenes to
be restored here?</p>

<p>We know that Eupolis, whose name stands next below in
the list, won a victory at the City Dionysia of 421 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and that
Hermippus and Cratinus were successful at the City festival in
422 and 423 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, respectively. This leaves the City Dionysia
of 424 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> for some unknown victor, who may have been Aristophanes
producing a play in his own name. But, on the other
hand, these victories of Hermippus and Cratinus were certainly
not their first, and it is possible that the victory of Eupolis in
421 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> was also not his first. If any of these men was in fact
the City victor in 424 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Aristophanes’ name could be read at
this point on the stone only by supposing that he had won a City
victory at some date prior to the <i>Knights</i> and consequently with
a play which had been brought out by another. If this hypothesis
is correct, it would automatically be established that at this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
period victories were credited to the actual poet rather than to
his didascalus. The argument here is by no means conclusive,
however, and most authorities follow Dr. Wilhelm in restoring
the name of Aristomenes, another poet who belonged to the
same general period.</p>

<p>The same problem recurs in connection with the comic
Victors’-List for the Lenaea (<a href="#figure79">Fig. 79</a>).<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Here Aristophanes’ name
is certainly to be restored somewhere in the lacuna below the
name of Eupolis in the first column. But whether his name
stood in a position corresponding to his own victory in 424 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
or in one corresponding to his victory through the agency of
Callistratus in the previous year, or whether (to state it differently)
the name of Callistratus must be restored ahead of Aristophanes’
own name because of his victory in 425 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
questions which are still incapable of categorical answers. Lack
of space will prevent a further argument of the matter, and I
must close with a summary of Dr. Jachmann’s conclusions.
His discussion is not only the latest but takes certain factors
into account which had previously been ignored. He points
out that the archons’ records, Aristotle’s <i>Didascaliae</i>, and the
different types of inscriptions must be sharply differentiated and
that the first named are the ultimate source of all the others.
The archons, of course, kept their records with no thought of
later literary investigations but mainly with a view to having a
definite list of men whom they were to hold responsible for
different events upon their programs. Naturally, then, they
had no interest in current or subsequent charges of plagiarism,
pretended authorship, etc. Jachmann maintains that prior
to about 380 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the archons entered the name of the didascalus
alone, but after that date they recorded the names of both
didascalus and poet when these differed. He supposes the
change to have been due to a law, which was made necessary
by the increasing practice of intrusting plays to men who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
not their authors and to the consequent differentiation of function
between poets and didascali. According to Jachmann the
same situation probably obtained also in Aristotle’s <i>Didascaliae</i>;
but in the Victors’-Lists and the inscriptional Didascaliae only the
didascali were listed before 380 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and after that date only the
poets. In the Fasti, on the contrary, only the didascali, as the
use of the verb ἐδίδασκε would indicate, appeared at any time.</p>

<p>Besides some other inscriptions of lesser importance than
those already discussed, Aristotle’s <i>Didascaliae</i> was the source,
directly or indirectly, also of several treatises, collections of
classified data, catalogues, etc., dealing with various phases of
Greek theatrical history and compiled by such men as Dicaearchus,
Callimachus, and Aristophanes of Byzantium. I shall
close with an account of one of these. I refer to the system of
numbering which was applied to ancient plays. Thus, according
to the ancient hypothesis (argument) to Sophocles’ <i>Antigone</i>
that drama “was counted the thirty-second” (λέλεκται δὲ τὸ
δρᾶμα τοῦτο τριακοστὸν δεύτερον), and the first hypothesis to
Aristophanes’ <i>Birds</i> declares that that comedy “is the thirty-fifth”
(ἔστι δὲ λέ). Before going farther it will be best to state
that the latter numeral is inexplicable under any theory, but
that Dindorf’s substitution of ιέ for λέ (“fifteen” for “thirty-five”)
is a satisfactory and convincing emendation. With the
publication of the Vatican hypothesis to Euripides’ <i>Alcestis</i> in
1834 a third numeral came to light: τὸ δρᾶμα ἐποιήθη ι̅ζ̅ (“the
drama was made seventeenth”). By far the most significant
numeral, however, was published in the <i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri</i>
in 1904. Here at the top of the last column of a hypothesis to
Cratinus’ lost <i>Dionysalexandros</i> stood the following heading,
doubtless repeated from the beginning of the hypothesis, which
is now lost:</p>

<p>Finally, one of the fragmentary hypotheses to two of Menander’s
plays published in the <i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri</i> of 1914 begins as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
follows: “The <i>Imbrians</i>, commencing ‘For how long a time,
Demeas, my good man, I ... you.’ This he wrote in the
archonship of Nicocles, being his [7·]th play (ταύτην [ἔγρα]ψεν
ἐπὶ Νικοκλέο[υς..]την καὶ ἑβδομηκοστ[ήν]), and he gave it for
production at the Dionysia; but on account of the tyrant
Lachares the festival was not celebrated. Subsequently it was
acted by the Athenian Callippus.” This numeral is partly
illegible, but was in the seventies, probably seventy-first,
seventy-third, seventy-sixth, or seventy-ninth, possibly seventy-fourth
or seventy-fifth.</p>

<p>The interpretation of these numerals has suffered from the
fact that they did not become known simultaneously and from
the further fact that for the most part explanations have been
advanced by editors who contented themselves with proposing
the most plausible interpretation of the particular numeral
before them without taking the others into consideration. Of
the many suggestions offered I shall here confine my discussion to
two, the chronological and the alphabetical. The former interpretation
is the oldest and receives confirmation from the fact
that Terence’s comedies are not only arranged chronologically
in our manuscripts but are provided with numerals on that basis
in the didascalic notices which are prefixed to these Latin plays.
These numbers, of course, would trace back the system only to
the Romans and to about the time of Varro in the first century
b.c. But inasmuch as Aeschines’ speeches are arranged on the
same principle, there can be no doubt that the Alexandrian
Greeks were familiar with it. The chronological interpretation,
however, has been open to three objections: (1) It is impossible
for Aristophanes’ <i>Birds</i> to have been thirty-fifth in a chronological
arrangement of his plays. This obstacle may be evaded by
accepting Dindorf’s emendation. (2) The <i>Antigone</i> and <i>Alcestis</i>
numerals are somewhat smaller than we might expect, since they
seem to assign too few plays to the earlier years of Sophocles’ and
Euripides’ activity as playwrights. This is not a serious objection
but must be taken into account. (3) The <i>Alcestis</i> took
the place of a satyric drama and therefore stood fourth in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
group. Consequently its numeral ought to be divisible by four,
and the number seventeen does not satisfy this requirement and
does not seem consistent with the tetralogic system employed
at the City Dionysia during this period.</p>

<p>These difficulties are not insuperable, but first I wish to refer
to another interpretation, which has enjoyed great popularity.
There is no doubt that the Greeks were acquainted, and at an
early date, with the alphabetical arrangement of titles. The
Oxyrhynchus arguments to Menander’s plays, for example,
seem to have been arranged in accordance with this principle.
The objection that there would be no point in recording numerals
derived from an alphabetical system for the reason that it would
be as easy to turn to a given play by means of its initial letters
as by means of its number is invalid because in alphabetical
lists the Greeks ignored all letters except the first. For example,
fifteen of Euripides’ extant titles begin with alpha, and there
was no a priori method of knowing which of the fifteen places
available the <i>Alcestis</i> would occupy (<a href="#figure80">Fig. 80</a>).<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> It becomes
necessary, then, to examine the alphabetical explanation without
prejudice, and fortunately it is now possible to reach an incontrovertible
conclusion. The numerals have never lent themselves
cordially to this interpretation, but the final <i>coup de grâce</i>
was delivered by the recent discovery of the numeral for
Menander’s <i>Imbrians</i>. Menander is said to have written from
one hundred and five to one hundred and nine pieces, but only
eighty-six titles are now known. Fifty-one of these, however,
have initial letters which come after iota in the Greek alphabet.
Now the smallest restoration which is possible for the Menander
numeral is seventy-one, and seventy-one plus fifty-one make
one hundred and twenty-two, or thirteen more than the largest
number recorded by any authority as the aggregate of Menander’s
works. Therefore the alphabetical explanation must be rejected.</p>

  <p class="captionref"><a href="#Footnote_380">See p. 332, n. 1</a></p>
</div>

<p>We may now return to the chronological interpretation, and
first let us note the light which the <i>Dionysalexandros</i> numeral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
throws upon the situation. It is significant that this number
is not incorporated within the hypothesis but stood at the top
of the last column and had doubtless appeared also at the
beginning of the hypothesis (now lost). In my opinion this was
the original form of such a notice and shows why in the fuller
form of statement found elsewhere a different verb is employed
in each case—λέλεκται, ἔστι,
ἐποιήθη, and ἔγραψεν. When
Aristophanes of Byzantium,
or whoever was responsible
for the change, transferred
these items from the heading
and made them integral parts
of the hypothesis, finding no
verb in the original version
before him and resting under
the necessity of now using
one, he did not deem it essential
to paraphrase the
information always in the
same way but, as was natural,
employed now one expression
and now another. If it be
true that the original function
of the numerals was as we find
it in the Cratinus hypothesis, only one explanation is possible—it
was a device for the convenience of some library, probably
that at Alexandria. If so, every play in the collection would
bear a number and these numbers would run consecutively for
each author. In other words if any play were not preserved in
the library, that fact would not be indicated by an unoccupied
number being left as a gap in the enumeration. Of course it is
conceivable that the basis of arrangement was purely arbitrary
and even varied with each author, and in fact there has been
a distinct tendency among recent authorities to accept some
such pessimistic conclusion. But it is more probable, until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
contrary be proved, that some rational system (alphabetical,
chronological, etc.) was employed and employed consistently.</p>

<p>Now there can be little room left for doubt as to what system
was actually chosen, when it is observed that the foregoing
statement of the numerals’ purpose and use obviates two of the
three objections to the chronological interpretation. Euripides
produced his first play in 455 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and died in 406 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He is
said to have written ninety-two plays, or an average of one and
four-fifths per annum. If the <i>Alcestis</i> were actually his seventeenth
piece he must have written less than one play a year
between 455 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and 438 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when the <i>Alcestis</i> was produced,
and two and one-third plays a year thereafter. It is true that
Euripides’ career opened slowly and that many of his later works
are characterized by hasty and careless execution. But this
disparity is too great, even apart from the objection that <i>ex
hypothesi</i> the <i>Alcestis</i> numeral ought to be a multiple of four.
If we suppose, however, that only the plays that were preserved
received a number, the situation at once clears. We are informed
that seventy-eight of Euripides’ works (four of them spurious)
were preserved. This is confirmed by the fact that seventy-two
of his titles are now known, for the number of titles now extant
generally approximates closely the number of an author’s plays
which were known by the ancients. If, then, the <i>Alcestis</i> was
seventeenth among the seventy-eight works which were passing
under the name of Euripides in antiquity and if it retained the
same relative position as in the complete list, it must have been
about the twentieth play which he brought out. This number,
being divisible by four, would be suitable for the last play of a
tetralogy and would have the merit of reducing slightly the
disproportion between the earlier and the later activity of the
poet. Moreover, since the earlier plays of a dramatist are more
likely to have been lost than the later ones, it is possible to
suppose that the <i>Alcestis</i> may have been twenty-fourth or
even twenty-eighth in a complete list (chronological) of his
writings. The point is that the purpose of the numerals as
deducible from the <i>Dionysalexandros</i> instance is capable of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
obviating all objections to the chronological interpretation of
the <i>Alcestis</i> numeral.</p>

<p>Similarly, Sophocles is said to have written one hundred and
twenty-three plays, and his career extended from about 468 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
to 406 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, yielding an average of about two plays per annum.
Inasmuch as the <i>Antigone</i> was probably performed in 441 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
and bears the numeral thirty-two, an unmodified chronological
interpretation would give an average of one and one-seventh
plays a year for Sophocles’ earlier period and of two and three-sevenths
for his later period. But we now have fragments of
somewhat more than one hundred Sophoclean plays; and if the
<i>Antigone</i> was thirty-second among these and retained the same
relative position as at first, it would have been about the thirty-seventh
play which Sophocles wrote. Of course this is a mere
estimate, but again this solution has the merit of assigning a
slightly larger number of plays to the earlier years of the poet
and of reducing, to that extent, the only objection to the
chronological interpretation of this numeral.</p>

<p>Aristophanes’ first comedy was produced in 427 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and his
last one not much later than 388 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> To him were attributed
forty-four plays, four of which were considered spurious. Apparently
all of his works were known to the ancients. The <i>Birds</i>
was produced at the City Dionysia of 414 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> in the fourteenth
year of his activity as a playwright. There is, therefore, no
a priori reason for refusing to believe that it was Aristophanes’
fifteenth play. Nor does any obstacle arise from the chronology
of the plays, so far as they can be dated. On the other hand the
traditional numeral, thirty-five, is inexplicable under any logical
system of enumeration, while Dindorf’s emendation is paleographically
simple. Therefore we must accept the substitution
and the chronological interpretation.</p>

<p>Cratinus’ career began about 452 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and closed in 423 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
or soon thereafter. Most scholars suppose his <i>Dionysalexandros</i>
to have been brought out in 430 or 429 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, though I was myself
at first inclined to favor an earlier date. He is said to have
written twenty-one plays. Twenty-six titles, however, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
accepted for him by Meineke and Kock in their editions of the
Greek comic fragments. Probably a few of these titles must be
rejected as spurious or transferred to the younger Cratinus, but
it is also possible that Cratinus was much more productive than
is commonly supposed and that twenty-one was the number
of his preserved works in Alexandrian times, not of all that he
had composed. As the custom of publishing comedies seems to
have started only at about the beginning of Cratinus’ career (see
<a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>, above), it would not be surprising if many of his plays,
especially of his earlier plays, were lost. At any rate in a chronological
arrangement of twenty-one comedies, whether they were
the whole or only the preserved part of Cratinus’ work, the
<i>Dionysalexandros</i> could be the eighth. These conclusions are
acceptable to Professor R. H. Tanner, who will shortly publish
a dissertation dealing with the chronology of Cratinus’ plays
and whose results on the point now under discussion he has
kindly permitted me to summarize here. He follows Croiset
in assigning the <i>Dionysalexandros</i> to the Lenaea of 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; six
plays he definitely dates before the <i>Dionysalexandros</i>, and a
seventh somewhat less positively. In the thirteen remaining
he has found nothing to indicate a date prior to 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Some
of them certainly belong to the period subsequent to 430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
It will be seen that these conclusions are in thorough accord
with my interpretation of the numeral.</p>

<p>The chronology of Menander’s life is not free from uncertainties,
but these do not seriously affect the present discussion.
His first play was performed perhaps as early as 324 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and
his decease probably took place in 292/1 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> During these
thirty-three or thirty-four years he composed some one hundred
and nine pieces or slightly over three per annum. Now Nicocles
was archon in 302/1 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> If, then, the hypothesis is correct in
assigning the <i>Imbrians</i> to the archonship of this man, the number
seventy-one (the smallest restoration which is possible) or
seventy-nine (the largest possible) would almost perfectly fit
the requirements of the case. Eighty-six Menandrian titles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
are now known, and it is not likely that many of his plays were
lost in Alexandrian times.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, summarize the preceding discussion as
follows: If we follow Dindorf in reading ιέ for λέ in the hypothesis
to Aristophanes’ <i>Birds</i>, the numerals are capable of a uniform
interpretation; they were a library device and were assigned
to the plays represented in some collection, most probably that
at Alexandria, according to the dates of their premières. It is
needless to state that in establishing the chronological sequence
of the plays in their possession the library authorities would
depend upon Aristotle’s <i>Didascaliae</i> or other handbooks derived
therefrom.</p>

of an Arcadian community, the Cynaethaens, of whom Pausanias (viii. 19. 1)
speaks as follows: “And as to the things most worthy of mention there is a shrine of
Dionysus there, and in the winter season they celebrate a festival, in which men

obtained with reference to the Eleusinian mysteries in their later forms.</p>

<p>The indebtedness of tragedy to epic poetry for subject matter, dignity of treatment
and of diction, and development of plot, including such technical devices as
recognition (ἀναγνώρισις) and reversal of situation (περιπέτεια) is too well established
to require argument. Aeschylus is said to have declared that his tragedies
were “slices from Homer’s bountiful banquets” (Athenaeus, p. 347E). The pertinent

Note that the earliest name was simply Σάτυροι, “satyrs.” Murray has proposed
another interpretation of Suidas’ phrase: “I take this to mean that Pratinas was
the first person to write words for the revelling masquers to learn by heart. Thespis,
like many early Elizabethans, had been content with a general direction:
‘Enter Satyrs, in revel, saying anything’” (incorporated in Miss Harrison’s <i>Themis</i>,

still other respects from the epirrhematic syzygy of the parabasis. Three syzygies
appear in Aristophanes’ <i>Acharnians</i> and <i>Birds</i>, none in his <i>Lysistrata</i>, <i>Women in

Aristophanes is not to be understood as discontinuing the use of the phallus altogether

observe the aesthetic law that not more than three persons should participate in the
same conversation (cf. Rees, <i>The So-called Rule of Three Actors in the Classical
Greek Drama</i>, p. 9, n. 1). When the only speakers were the individual choreutae,
who were twenty-four in number, such a restriction must have been unheard of.
On the other hand, if it should prove true that Megarian actors were brought in
before the time of Cratinus, then we must suppose that their number was at first
in excess of three and was reduced to three by him. Of course, the use of but
three actors in the tragedy and comedy of this period would automatically result
in not more than three persons participating in a conversation and so in the observance
of the aesthetic law. This statement, however, is subject to the qualification
that the chorus leaders continued to have speaking parts both in comedy (see <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>,
above), and in tragedy (cf. <a href="#Page_164">pp. 164 f.</a> and <a href="#Page_169">169</a>, below), and that a fourth actor was
occasionally employed (cf. <a href="#Page_171">pp. 171</a> and <a href="#Page_182">182</a>, below). In any case I am of the
opinion that conscious formulation of the aesthetic law was not made until
Hellenistic times (see <a href="#Page_187">pp. 187 f.</a>, below).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118" class="label">[118]</a> It is unfortunate that there is at present no satisfactory book dealing with
the Greek theater on the structural side. English readers are practically restricted
to Haigh’s <i>The Attic Theatre</i>, revised by Pickard-Cambridge in 1907, which devotes
nearly one hundred pages to a summary and criticism of the different views. But
this work has already been off the press for a decade and on the main issue, viz.,
as to whether the Greek theater of the classical period was provided with a raised
stage for actors, makes too many concessions to the traditional view. For German
readers, on the other hand, the situation is not a great deal better. Dörpfeld’s
book has been before the public for over twenty years, and in the interim his
opinions have necessarily changed on many points. He has promised a thoroughly
revised second edition, which is demanded also by the excavation of additional
theaters and by the publication of numerous special articles. But it is hardly
likely that this promise will ever be redeemed. The only comfort is to be derived
from the fact that, as works of major importance have appeared, Dörpfeld has
promptly published critiques which have often been of such length as to furnish
convenient restatements of his views. These more recent works in German,
however, have attempted merely to force a modification of certain details in Dörpfeld’s
position; they are in no wise calculated to serve as independent presentations
of the whole matter or as a means of orientation for the uninitiated.</p>

<p>From the extensive bibliographical material which is available it is manifestly
impossible to cite more than a fraction here. The outstanding books are Dörpfeld-Reisch,
<i>Das griechische Theater</i> (1896), defended against reviewers and partially
modified in “Das griechische Theater Vitruvs,” <i>Athenische Mittheilungen</i>, XXII
(1897), 439 ff., and XXIII (1898), 326 ff.; Puchstein, <i>Die griechische Bühne</i>
(1901), answered by Dörpfeld in <i>Athenische Mittheilungen</i>, XXVIII (1903),
383 ff.; and Fiechter, <i>Die baugeschichtliche Entwicklung des antiken Theaters</i>
(1914), summarized by its author and criticized by Dörpfeld in <i>Jahrbuch d. arch.
Instituts, Anzeiger</i>, XXX (1915), 93 ff. and 96 ff., respectively. Other important
publications are von Wilamowitz-Möllendorff, “Die Bühne des Aischylos,” <i>Hermes</i>,
XXI (1886), 597 ff.; Todt, “Noch Einmal die Bühne des Aeschylos,” <i>Philologus</i>,
XLVIII (1889), 505 ff.; Capps, “Vitruvius and the Greek Stage,” <i>University of
Chicago Studies in Classical Philology</i>, I (1893), 3 ff.; Bethe, <i>Prolegomena zur

ihre Decorationen,” <i>Jahrbuch d. arch. Instituts</i>, XV (1900), 59 ff. (answered by
Dörpfeld in “Die vermeintliche Bühne des hellenistischen Theaters,” <i>ibid.</i>, XVI
[1901], 22 ff.); Petersen, “Nachlese in Athen: Das Theater des Dionysos,” <i>ibid.</i>,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121" class="label">[121]</a> Dörpfeld claims that the name was given because the speakers stood there in
addressing the public assemblies and that the same place was known as the <i>theologium</i>
when used by divinities; cf. <i>Athenische Mittheilungen</i>, XXIII (1898), 348 f.,
and XXVIII (1903), 395, and <i>Jahrbuch d. arch. Instituts, Anzeiger</i>, XXX (1915),
98. Reisch thought that logium was the name of some kind of special structure
in the orchestra; cf. <i>Das griechische Theater</i>, p. 302. Inscriptions prove the presence
of a logium in the Delian theater in 279 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (εἰς τὸ λογεῖον τῆς σκηνῆς) and
180 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> (τὴν κατασκευὴν τῶν πινάκων τῶν ἐπὶ τὸ λογεῖον); cf. Homolle, <i>Bulletin de
Correspondance Hellénique</i>, XVIII (1894), 162 and 165, and Robinson, <i>American
Journal of Philology</i>, XXV (1904), 191; but they do not make its nature clear.
Personally I am of the opinion that at Athens speakers always stood in the orchestra
to address the public assemblies until the building of the Nero stage about 67 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>;
cf. Flickinger, <i>Plutarch as a Source of Information on the Greek Theater</i> (1904),
p. 55, and see <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>, below. My present view, therefore, is that logium suffered
a change of meaning, being first applied to the top of the proscenium and being
used for elevated action of various kinds, as explained in the text, and afterward
being applied to the stage as the place of actors and public speakers. In either
case, it referred to the same general part of the theater, viz., an elevated platform
in front of the scene-building. But the original application of this term is one of
the most perplexing problems in connection with scenic antiquities, and it is
earnestly to be hoped that additional evidence may be brought to light which will
unmistakably reveal its earlier history. The word does not appear in literature
until Roman times (thrice in Plutarch), but then indisputably means “stage.”

<p><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">[122]</a> “Theater” (θέατρον) is derived from θεᾶσθαι, to “see,” and was originally

excavated place”) to express the narrower meaning.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124" class="label">[124]</a> That this platform (or rather its equivalent in purely Roman theaters)

secondary meanings; cf. Flickinger, <i>Plutarch as a Source of Information on the
Greek Theater</i>, pp. 23 ff., and Scherling, <i>De Vocis</i> Σκηνή, <i>Quantum ad Theatrum
Graecum Pertinet, Significatione et Usu</i> (1906). Thymele is sometimes extended in
application so as to denote the whole orchestra; hence θυμελικός was sometimes
applied to purely orchestral performers (or their performances) in contradistinction
to those who came into more immediate relationship with the scene-building and
who were in consequence known as σκηνικοί (see <a href="#Page_96">pp. 96 f.</a>, below).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_172" href="#FNanchor_172" class="label">[172]</a> It is easy to see why he should do so. When Hellenistic theaters were made
over into Graeco-Roman structures, several rows of seats were often removed,
resulting in a drop of several feet between the auditorium and the orchestra (see
<a href="#Page_116">p. 116</a>, below, and <a href="#figure24">Fig. 24</a>). So distinct a line of demarcation could scarcely be
ignored in favor of any less clearly marked boundary. In fact, the orchestra in
the narrowest sense (see next note) was sometimes not indicated at all in the
Graeco-Roman theaters.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_173" href="#FNanchor_173" class="label">[173]</a> The word is applied also to a still more restricted space which in some Graeco-Roman
and most earlier theaters is marked off by a circular boundary.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_174" href="#FNanchor_174" class="label">[174]</a> Of course, Dörpfeld and Fiechter cite only a fraction of the instances available
(others are given in Puchstein’s table, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 7), but it is to be inferred that they
bring forward those which are most favorable to their own position and most
difficult for their opponents to explain. For example, the proscenium of the
Hellenistic theater in Athens was about thirteen feet (English) high, which exceeds
Vitruvius’ maximum. Consequently Fiechter says nothing about it. In general,
the Hellenistic proscenia were higher than the Graeco-Roman stages.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_175" href="#FNanchor_175" class="label">[175]</a> Doubtless for the reason that in the pitlike Graeco-Roman orchestra the
smaller circle really was not needed and often was not indicated (see <a href="#Footnote_172">p. 83, n. 1</a>).</p>

projecting above the head and of thick-soled boots (κόθορνοι), both represented in
Fig. 66. The employment of such paraphernalia rests upon late evidence, however,
and has been disputed for fifth-century tragedy; cf. for example Smith,
“The Use of the High-soled Shoe or Buskin in Greek Tragedy of the Fifth or
Fourth Centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,” <i>Harvard Studies</i>, XVI (1905), 123 ff. For the costumes of

are the king of Corinth and his daughter, Jason’s second wife. The latter is
being assisted by her brother. In front lies an opened box which contained the
poisoned gifts. From the other side the queen comes rushing. In the foreground
is Medea slaying one of her children, while a youth tries to rescue the other. In
the center is Oistros, the demon of madness, mounted upon a dragon chariot.
Further on Jason is hastening to aid his boys, and on the extreme right is the ghost
of Aeetes, Medea’s father. The design is apparently not based upon Euripides’

prisms (<i>periacti</i>) with a different view painted on each of their three sides. These
could be turned to indicate a change of scene. There is no evidence, however, that
this contrivance was employed during the classical period of Greek drama, although
Dörpfeld thought that a place was provided for it in the earlier parascenia at
Epidaurus (cf. <i>Das griechische Theater</i>, p. 126). The <i>geranos</i> (“crane”) and the
<i>krade</i> (“branch”) were probably only other names for the μηχανή.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
